# Task Graph — Suno v5 Knowledge Base Migration

| Order | Folder → Document | Owner | Risk / Notes |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 1 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 00_00_AI_Assistant_System_Prompt.md | migration-agent | High: system prompt rewrite must align with v5 directives and remove v4.5 instructions. |
| 2 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 00_10_Master_Index.md | migration-agent | High: central index; requires comprehensive cross-link updates and v4.5→v5 deltas. |
| 3 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 10_10_Core_Principles.md | migration-agent | High: foundational doctrine; ensure examples adopt concise v5 syntax. |
| 4 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 10_20_Songwriting_Workflows.md | migration-agent | High: workflow re-engineering with stems/partial regen guidance. |
| 5 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 10_30_Troubleshooting_Framework.md | migration-agent | Medium: update issue list with v5 behaviors (boomy bass, length, exclusions). |
| 6 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 20_10_Platform_Updates.md | migration-agent | Medium: reframe as historical context + v5 callouts. |
| 7 | 01_Core_Knowledge → 20_20_Prompt_Syntax_Guide.md | migration-agent | High: must showcase v5 prompt grammar, EXCLUDE usage, JSON example. |
| 8 | 01_Core_Knowledge → Appendix_10_The_AI_Assisted_Artisan.md | migration-agent | Medium: update checklists with v5 stem workflow. |
| 9 | 02_Knowledge_Topics → Prompt Engineering Guides (multi-doc) | migration-agent | High: numerous prompt examples referencing v4.5; heavy rewrite required. |
| 10 | 02_Knowledge_Topics → Instrumentation & Structure docs | migration-agent | Medium: prune model-specific claims, keep evergreen craft. |
| 11 | 02_Knowledge_Topics → Compliance/Safety guidance | migration-agent | Medium: confirm Latest Knowledge coverage or tag TODO. |
| 12 | 02_Knowledge_Topics → Research frameworks (lyrics, taxonomy) | migration-agent | Low: largely model-agnostic; ensure separation from model references. |
| 13 | 04_Instructions/System Instructions (all) | migration-agent | High: convert assistant instructions to v5 voice, remove v4.5 terms. |
| 14 | 05_Misc → Features, Integrations, Tools | migration-agent | Medium: update any Suno feature references to v5 terminology. |
| 15 | Knowledge/v5.0 → 05_Misc/Song Blueprint Generator.md | migration-agent | Low: confirm independence from Suno; cross-link to v5 docs where relevant. |
| 16 | Quality → Knowledge/v5.0/_quality/report.md | migration-agent | Medium: maintain cognitive verifier log as docs migrate. |

Dependencies: complete Core Knowledge (tasks 1–8) before derivative topics (tasks 9–12). System instructions (task 13) depend on finalized prompt syntax (task 7). Misc updates (tasks 14–15) can proceed in parallel once relevant facts exist.
