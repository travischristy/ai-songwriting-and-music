# How to Write One Song: Loving the Things We Create and How They Love Us Back

---

## TRANSCRIPT:

```other
I'd like to dedicate this hopeful little book to all of the songs to come, yours and mine,
to all of those moments yet to unfold where we find ourselves awake to a possibility we hadn't anticipated,
to all of the songs like windows open just enough for us to make our escape,
and to all of the songs like windows closed and clear enough in a dim light to see our own reflection and be reminded of who we are.
Not one of these songs to come will save any of us for very long,
but keep writing and waiting and watching life as it reveals itself to us slowly over time.
Each song and each act of creativity indeed is an act of defiance in a world that often feels determined to destroy itself.
The songs we have yet to write will always be more important than the songs we've already sung,
and certainly more important than the songs we never bring to life.
I hope you, dear listener, will take this book in the spirit it was written,
as a humble request to write your one song today and tomorrow,
and each day after that, we have a choice,
to be on the side of creation, or surrender to the powers that destroy.
Introduction
Songs are mysterious.
Any idea where they come from?
I've written tons and tons of songs,
and still the best I can think to say after I finish one I'm happy with is,
how'd I do that?
It's confusing when you can do something and not know exactly how you did it,
and then somehow expect to do it again.
I think that's why so much mysticism gets attached to songwriting when people try to talk about it.
You hear things like,
I'm just a conduit,
and the universe wanted me to have this song.
Whatever you say, man,
I'm pretty sure it's still me doing the work.
Some partnership between my conscious mind and my subconscious gets results,
but when things are going right,
the distinctions between the two become blurry,
and I'm never really sure which is in charge.
So the idea of teaching songwriting feels more like teaching someone how to think,
or how to have ideas.
Because songs, to me, are much more like individual thoughts than other works of art are.
They're hard to hold on to, air-like and ephemeral.
They pass through time, they're here, then gone.
Yet they're portable, they can linger as a memory,
and even crazier, they can just pop into our minds for no discernible reason.
Other art forms, like paintings and books, have physical shapes and permanents,
but how many of them can you hum a few bars of?
Understandably, I think we all sort of assume songs are more conjured than written,
and it makes sense that people are skeptical about the idea that songwriting can be taught.
I mean, it's easy to see how a step-by-step approach might be applied to the craft of songwriting,
music theory, traditional song shapes, meter.
But in my experience, that's just the architecture.
How do you teach someone to write the kind of song that makes someone else want to write a song?
A song that you can fall in love with,
and a song that feels like it's capable of loving you back.
Can you teach that?
I'm not sure.
But I have a feeling that part of the problem is the enormity of teaching someone how to write songs, plural.
Instead, I believe that the only way to teach someone to write songs
would be through teaching them how to give themselves permission to write one song.
To teach them how to teach themselves, starting with one song.
To me, the difference between one song and songs is not some cute semantic trick.
It's an important distinction, and it's more precise about what you're actually doing.
No one writes songs, plural.
They write one song, and then another.
And it's also a reminder of what you really want, or what I think you should really want,
which is to disappear.
To watch your concept of time evaporate.
To live at least once inside a moment when you aren't trying to do anything,
or be anything anymore.
To spend time in a place where you just are.
Okay?
Okay.
That's all.
That's something that doesn't happen through songs, plural.
It happens only when you've lost yourself in the process of making one song.
Part One
One
Why?
Or do you need a reason to write a song?
Why I write songs?
Long before I wrote my first song, I thought of myself as a songwriter.
I would say to people, guess what?
I'm a songwriter.
Not, I might like to try my hand at songwriting someday.
Just, yep, I'm a songwriter.
It was bonkers.
I think I was around seven years old.
I was delusional.
I was a delusional seven-year-old,
and I had stumbled onto some internal TED Talk level trick of self-actualization.
It worked.
It turns out that the reason I started writing songs is because I happened to be a songwriter.
That, plus the looming sense as I got older, that it would only be a matter of time before someone would say,
boy, I'd love to hear one of your songs.
So I guess I found the desire to not be revealed as a complete fraud quite motivating as well.
Does that sound like you?
Do you like the idea of what it would feel like to be someone who writes songs?
Is that your answer to the question, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Maybe minus the awkward transition from, I'm thinking firefighter, maybe cowboy, you know,
I'd like to be something in the firefighting realm, but I'd also like to be on horseback if possible?
To the crazy conviction of,
songwriter, next question, grandpa.
Maybe your internal dialogue sounds something more like this.
I'd really like to be able to maybe write songs someday?
Okay, let me just settle this right off the bat.
You're a songwriter, no doubt about it.
And definitely as much as I was before I wrote any songs.
Phew.
I'm glad we got that out of the way.
All right then.
Thanks for buying the book.
Just kidding.
Ha.
That was hilarious.
Sorry.
I'm going to come at this from another angle, because I think it's as close to the core philosophy of this book as I can get.
And I believe it's worth repeating in a way that might be understood from a broader perspective than just songwriting.
The truth is that as I got older, the answer to what do you want to be became much more difficult to say out loud.
Even though I always had a pretty good idea that I wanted to write poems and songs and play music,
I always had a hard time telling people that I wanted to be a poet or a songwriter or an artist.
It still feels wrong sometimes to label myself as something so grand in my estimation.
Why?
Is it false modesty?
I doubt it.
My ego seems sturdy enough these days to tolerate some aggrandizement.
I think the disconnect is more related to the idea of being anything when it's the doing that's most rewarding.
Being something isn't real in the same way that doing something can be real.
Everyone has a different idea of a songwriter.
We all picture that differently.
Your songwriter wears a beret, doesn't she?
I knew it.
If you can pull off a beret, you can definitely write songs.
Anyway, my songwriter doesn't wear a beret or really think of himself as a songwriter at all unless he's writing a song.
That's another main reason I wanted the focus on one song to be reflected in the title of this book.
When you're in the act of creating, when you're actually focused on that one song,
and that focus is allowing you to disappear, which we've already established as ideal and to be desired,
there isn't anyone else's image of who you are to compete with.
In fact, even the image you have of yourself can take a breather.
So you want to be a star?
It's soul-crushing at any job to aspire to be something versus being driven by what you want to do.
Do you want to be a star?
Don't bother.
You're going to lose.
Even if you make it, you'll lose.
Because you're never going to be exactly what you're picturing.
But what do you want to do?
You want to play music in front of people?
You can do that.
You want to see if you can get better at playing in front of a larger group of people?
You might be able to do that.
I can even see someone deciding that they're going to create an outrageous persona and experiment with new musical forms.
And that might end up making them a rock star.
But I doubt the title is anywhere near as satisfying as the creation part.
Maybe it's a cliche, but you have to focus on verbs over nouns.
What you want to do, not what you want to be.
Keep things simple.
You want to be heard, listened to.
We all do.
So as stupid as it sounds, that only means you have to make a sound.
Many songwriters have aspired to be Bob Dylan, including me.
And is that an overambitious desire?
Yes and no.
Did I truly want to be Bob Dylan?
No.
I wanted to do what Bob Dylan does.
And on the most basic level, there was nothing stopping me from doing what Bob Dylan does.
That doesn't mean I can play the guitar or sing the same way or write songs the same way or as well.
It just means that I make a sound.
I write a song and I sing it.
At the very least, I hear myself.
If you're coming to me for inspiration because you want to sound like me or be me, well, I'm flattered.
But you'll be surprised how good it feels to hear yourself sing your own song.
Will one song be enough?
For some reason, I feel the need to clearly explain how I distinguish between an aspiration and an accomplishment.
To me, aspiration is a word that is reserved for your loftiest goals, your dreams.
I think to aspire is to aim for something just out of reach or something far away temporally, your end goal maybe.
It's more related to the idea of how you want your work to be acknowledged.
An achievement can mean sort of the same thing, I suppose.
But I would argue that an achievement is something clearly defined and attainable.
I think aspirations are great and I think you should dream big.
It's hard to do something you can't envision.
So close your eyes and picture something wonderful every chance you get.
But for now, let's just take a look at what you're trying to accomplish.
Are you trying to create a body of work?
Or could one song be enough?
Just to see what it feels like to have your own song to sing?
Because one song is all it takes to make a connection.
And in my opinion, connection is the loftiest of all aspirations.
To my way of thinking, there isn't much else of any value going on in any song or work of art.
At the core of any creative act is an impulse to make manifest our powerful desire to connect with others, with ourselves, with the sacred, with God.
We all want to feel less alone and I believe that a song being sung is one of the clearest views we ever have to witness how humans reach out for warmth with our art.
I'm sure you felt that as a listener too.
That warmth works both ways.
We look for it in the art we choose, in the music we listen to.
But how do you make a song do that?
How can you be sure you're making that connection happen?
I think to get there, we have to start with ourselves.
And to connect with ourselves, I believe, requires an effort to tune into our own thoughts and feelings through practice or habit.
Before my dad died, he asked me,
How old are you?
Dad was never the most attentive father.
I told him I was 50.
He said,
That's great.
The years between when I was 45 and 55 were the most productive of my whole life.
And I was thinking,
How is he productive?
My dad worked for the railroad his entire career.
I guess he made improvements to the safety and productivity of the rail yard.
Maybe he configured the computers in the tower or something.
He had a lot of expertise in electronics.
And he looked at his career as having some productivity that he felt connected to.
But I've always wondered if he meant something else.
It's really interesting how you recognize genetics and see yourself in your relatives and your family as you grow older.
My father did have the impulse to sit down and write poetry.
He would go to the basement from time to time when he was upset about something or when he was mad.
And he'd sit and write a poem.
And then come upstairs half drunk and read a simplistic, heavily rhyming, but not entirely artless poem about the Alton and Southern Railway.
Or our neighbor who died.
Or something else that he was stewing about.
We didn't have many books in our house.
We hardly had any high-minded notions about who we were as a family.
And for all I know, book reading might have been akin to putting on airs.
Dad was a high school dropout.
My mother was a high school dropout.
But I think they were both brilliant.
I mean, really fucking smart.
At some point, my dad must have realized that there were things he needed to say that didn't mean as much or sound right without some rhyming.
Hmm.
A poem.
I bet you I could write one of those.
He probably wrote them at work in his head.
What's more curious is how he gave himself permission to do it.
I think a lot of people write poems in their heads but don't give themselves permission to write them down or share them.
I'm sure the beer provided some confidence, some internal urging and support that led to the late evening recitals.
But when he first sat down to write, it was always straight after work.
He was sober as a judge and riding a wave of pure inspiration.
I want to be a person who encourages more humans to do that.
To have some private moments of creativity, whether they share their creations or not.
We should have an army of people advocating for that.
I think it's the coolest thing in the world when someone steps outside their so-called station in life to indulge in a personal art-for-the-sake-of-art moment.
If we're being realistic about what an end goal should be, creating something with no ambition other than to get something off our chest might be the purest thing anyone could aim for.
2. The hardest part. Getting started.
Put yourself on the path.
I happen to love deadlines.
Not everyone does.
I do.
Because they fit with my belief that art isn't ever really complete.
As the saying goes, no work of art is ever finished.
It can only be abandoned in an interesting place.
It's a little soon to delve into my particular routines, but at this point in my life, I write with such regularity that being given a deadline, for example, an exact date when an album needs to be delivered to the mastering lab, is basically a pencils-down alarm bell that allows me to stop making up new songs and to spend some time whipping an LP's worth of tunes into shape.
Maybe that's not the level of commitment we're shooting for here, at least not yet, since we are focused on just one song.
At any rate, we're going to have to unlock what motivates you to get started.
Knowing how to write a song isn't going to help you much if you never find the inspiration or discipline to get started.
I think I taught myself this lesson during the making of Summer Teeth.
We had finished the record and we were happy with it, but the execs at the label said to me literally the most cliched thing anyone could ever picture a record exec saying.
We don't hear a single.
So, they wanted another song.
And this one better be good.
I'll spare you the deliberations that went on behind the scenes, and my own annoyance about the whole thing.
In my mind, every song I'd just delivered was a solid gold pop gem.
But I lied and said, boy, I have just the song.
That even though we'd just spent months making a record, I'd for some reason forgotten to mention the surefire hit I'd been keeping in my back pocket.
In reality, I had no such song, of course, but I thought it'd be interesting, since they were paying for it, to fly to L.A. and pretend that I knew what a chart-scorching pop song sounds like.
I wrote most of Can't Stand It on the plane.
It was the first time I confirmed for myself that inspiration wasn't always the first ingredient in a song.
In this case, it was demand.
Eventually, I found inspiration in the process and even felt good about taking their money to teach myself that lesson.
The song didn't chart, even though the label dudes claimed that they loved it and they were going to give it the big push.
So it goes.
The point is, when I say something like, inspiration is overrated, it's not because I think you don't ever need to be inspired.
What I'm trying to tell you, and what I still tell myself frequently, is that inspiration is rarely the first step.
When it does come out of the blue, it's glorious, but it's much more in your own hands than the divine intervention-type beliefs we all tend to have about inspiration.
Most of the time, inspiration has to be invited.
Process.
To me, process is whatever act you can engage in, whatever steps you can take, and whatever device you have at your disposal that you can use, together, that reliably results in a work of art.
Process is also the only name I know of for whatever series of contortions and mental tricks we have available to lose ourselves in when we create.
It's the door to the disappearing that I've already described as my ultimate desired creative state, being able to get gone enough, long enough, for a song to appear.
Beyond what it helps me create, disappearing is also the most sustaining part of what I do.
It's the part that's long over with way before a record comes out.
I've talked to other songwriters about this, and some have pointed out how it can also be a vital part of performing.
How it's important to get to a place where you're confident enough to prevent your ego from overseeing every move and hiding your vulnerability.
When I'm on stage, my experience often goes something like this.
Blankness.
Bliss.
Blankness.
Blankness.
Twinkle of awareness that rocking has been achieved.
Bliss.
Voice of observing ego yelling over amplifiers.
Wow!
You're really fucking killing it, dude!
Clang.
Wrong chord.
My ego does that to me all the time.
That's kind of having an ego in a nutshell.
It's there to build you up and protect you.
To protect your idea of yourself as smart and handsome and someone who should be taken seriously and never laughed at.
Your ego wants to conceal your insecurity and your fear, and that's why it can be such an unwelcome intrusion when you're trying to create or perform.
You need your human frailty to be at least somewhat visible if you want to connect on an emotional level.
If you want things to feel real.
So that's why I surrender to process.
Why I so regularly employ the mental tricks that I'm going to talk about later in the book.
The tricks that get me in the right frame of mind to create.
It makes it easier to have moments of truth and recognition, and it gets my ego out of the way.
And getting my ego out of the way makes it easier to listen to myself with some objectivity.
To hear myself almost as a different person would.
So if you can give yourself over to a process and get comfortable with disappearing, you're likely to harvest some hard-to-find truth along the way.
Both about yourself and about what you're trying to say.
Don't worry about your ego.
It'll be fine taking the back seat for a while, trust me.
It's never gone for long.
It'll be there to help figure out what to do with whatever you make, take credit for the parts people love, make excuses for any shortcomings, decide what font and point size to use on the poster, etc.
In the end, learning how to disappear is the best way I've found to make my true self visible to myself and others.
Inspiration vs. Craft
Let's talk more about what we call inspiration.
It's overrated.
Have we established that?
As you know pretty well if you've listened this far, I believe that you have to invite inspiration in.
I've found that most people who have a fulfilling life in art are, like me, the people who work at it every day and put the tools of creation in their hands frequently.
Who not only invite inspiration in, but also do it on a regular basis.
Instead of waiting to be struck by inspiration, they put themselves directly in its path.
Pick up a guitar and you're much more likely to write a song.
Pick up a pencil, etc.
There's little doubt in my mind that because I do so much of that planned, methodical thinking in which I put the tools of inspiration
```

**In-Depth Analysis and Report: Audiobook Transcription (Jeff Tweedy - "How to Write One Song")**

**I. Executive Summary**

This audiobook transcription, presumably of Jeff Tweedy's "How to Write One Song," is a deeply personal and encouraging guide aimed at demystifying the songwriting process. It champions the idea of focusing on writing just "one song" as a manageable and rewarding goal, emphasizing the creative process over the end product. Tweedy combines personal anecdotes from his life and career (including with Wilco), philosophical reflections on art and creativity, and practical exercises to help listeners overcome mental blocks and engage with their own creative potential. The overarching message is one of permission: giving oneself permission to create, to fail, to be a "songwriter" simply by doing, and to find joy and connection through the act of songwriting. The inclusion of the "Audible" branding at the beginning and end, along with a "bonus track" of Tweedy's song "Gwendolyn" (shown in its developmental stages), confirms its audiobook nature and offers a practical demonstration of his methods.

**II. Author and Intended Audience**

- **Author:** Jeff Tweedy, best known as the frontman of the band Wilco. His voice is authentic, drawing from decades of experience as a critically acclaimed and prolific songwriter. His perspective is that of a working artist who has grappled with self-doubt, addiction, and the pressures of the music industry, lending credibility and empathy to his advice.
- **Intended Audience:**
    - Aspiring songwriters who feel intimidated or unsure how to start.
    - Musicians or writers experiencing creative blocks.
    - Fans of Jeff Tweedy and Wilco interested in his creative process.
    - Anyone seeking to incorporate more creativity into their lives, even if not specifically aiming for a music career.
    - Individuals who appreciate a philosophical yet down-to-earth approach to art-making.

**III. Core Message and Philosophy**

The central tenet of the book is to **focus on writing "one song."** This approach is designed to:

- **Reduce Overwhelm:** Instead of the daunting task of "writing songs" (plural), "one song" feels achievable.
- **Emphasize Process over Product:** Tweedy repeatedly states that the act of creation, the "disappearing" into the process, is the primary reward. The quality of the finished song is secondary to the experience of making it.
- **Grant Permission:** A significant theme is giving oneself permission – to try, to fail, to sound "bad," to claim the identity of a songwriter simply by writing.
- **Demystify Songwriting:** He argues against the notion that songwriting is purely mystical or requires innate genius, suggesting it's more about consistent effort, openness, and learning to work with one's conscious and subconscious mind.
- **Connection as a Goal:** Songwriting is presented as a way to connect with oneself, with others, and with something larger ("the sacred," "God").

**IV. Key Themes Explored**

1. **The Power of "One Song":** Making the daunting task manageable.
2. **Process vs. Product:** Finding joy and fulfillment in the act of creation itself.
3. **Permission and Self-Doubt:** Overcoming internal critics and societal expectations.
4. **Inspiration vs. Craft/Discipline:** Inspiration is "invited" through regular work and process, not passively waited for.
5. **The Role of the Ego:** Recognizing the ego's tendency to judge and protect, and learning to bypass it during creation.
6. **"Disappearing":** Achieving a flow state where self-consciousness fades.
7. **Embracing Failure:** Viewing "bad" songs or failed attempts as necessary steps and learning opportunities.
8. **Authenticity and Finding Your Voice:** Even when experimenting with different perspectives, the unique self emerges.
9. **The Music of Words:** Exploring the inherent musicality and poetic potential of language.
10. **Stealing (Appropriation):** Learning from and reinterpreting the work of others as a valid creative technique.
11. **Connection and Vulnerability:** Sharing one's work as an act of reaching out.
12. **Creativity as a Human Need/Gift:** The idea that everyone possesses creative potential and benefits from exercising it.
13. **Memory and Association:** How songs tap into and create memories and unexpected connections.

**V. Structure and Content Breakdown**

The book is structured to guide the listener from philosophical considerations to practical application:

- **Audible Branding:** Standard audiobook intro.
- **Dedication:** Sets a hopeful and artistic tone.

    - **Chapter 1 (Why?):** Discusses identity as a songwriter, doing vs. being, aspirations vs. accomplishments, and the core desire for connection.
    - **Chapter 2 (The Hardest Part. Getting Started.):** Addresses motivation, deadlines (the "Can't Stand It" anecdote), the concept of "process," the role of ego, inspiration vs. craft, common excuses (no time, lack of skill/ideas, no musical training, not enough talent) and systematically debunks them.
- **Everyday Work & End Goals:**
    - Advocates for a daily work ethic and outlines Tweedy's own (stockpiling words/music, pairing).
    - Presents an "idealized" daily writing schedule (8 PM - 8 PM cycle).
    - Discusses end goals, emphasizing the process, embracing failure, the search for truth in art, and doing it for love (drawing analogy).
- **Part 2: Start Writing - The Music of Words (Exercises)**
    - **Chapter 7 (The Music of Words):** Explores words as inherently musical, the connection between songs and poetry, and "hotwiring language."
    - **Chapter 8 (Exercise 1: Word Ladder - Verbs and Nouns):** Pairing unrelated words.
    - **Chapter 9 (Exercise 2: Stealing words from a book):** Finding words that fit a melody by scanning text.
    - **Chapter 10 (Exercise 3: Cut-up techniques):** Re-arranging pre-written text.
    - **Chapter 11 (Exercise 4: Word Ladder Variation - The Dreaded Adjective):** Similar to Exercise 1 but with adjectives, cautioning against overuse.

**VI. Tone and Style**

- **Conversational and Intimate:** Tweedy speaks directly to the listener ("you, dear listener").
- **Encouraging and Empathetic:** He consistently validates the listener's potential struggles and fears.
- **Anecdotal:** Rich with personal stories that illustrate his points.
- **Philosophical yet Grounded:** Explores deep concepts about art and life but always brings it back to practical application.
- **Humorous and Self-Deprecating:** Lightens the tone and makes him relatable.
- **Passionate:** His deep love for songwriting and the creative process is evident throughout.
- **Slightly Meandering at Times:** Reflects a natural, thought-process style of delivery, which can be both a strength (authenticity) and a minor weakness (occasional repetition).

**VII. Strengths of the Audiobook**

- **Accessibility:** Successfully demystifies a process often seen as impenetrable.
- **Encouragement:** Provides powerful motivation for those lacking confidence.
- **Practical Exercises:** Offers concrete steps to start writing.
- **Authenticity:** Tweedy's personal experiences and honest reflections lend immense credibility.
- **Focus on Intrinsic Rewards:** Shifts the goal from external validation (fame, perfection) to internal fulfillment.
- **Holistic Approach:** Addresses the emotional, psychological, and practical aspects of songwriting.
- **The "Mumble Track" and "Gwendolyn" Example:** Provides a tangible and fascinating insight into his method.

**VIII. Potential Areas for Discussion/Critique**

- **Repetition:** Some core ideas (process over product, permission, inspiration needs invitation) are repeated frequently. While this aids retention in an audio format, it's noticeable in a transcription.
- **Subjectivity:** While a strength, some advice is deeply rooted in Tweedy's personal experience and may not resonate universally (e.g., his specific daily schedule, his particular relationship with ego).
- **Structure:** The flow between "Parts" can occasionally feel slightly loose, with themes sometimes revisited. The missing chapter numbers (13, and exercise 6) in the transcript are a minor point of confusion.
- **Idealized Day:** The "idealized writing day" is acknowledged as such, but its intensity could still be daunting for some.

**IX. Unique Elements**

- **The "Mumble Track" Technique:** A specific and intriguing method for developing lyrics from phonetic sounds sung over a melody.
- **The Inclusion of "Gwendolyn":** Demonstrating the evolution of a song from concept to finished product, directly applying the book's principles.
- **Jeff Tweedy's Voice:** His unique perspective as a successful, working musician who is also introspective and articulate about his craft.

**X. Statistical/Textual Observations**

- **Word Count:** The transcription is substantial, estimated at approximately 48,000-49,000 words.
- **Use of "Audible":** Appears 5 times at the beginning, indicating standard audiobook branding. The multiple "Thank you" instances at the end also fit this pattern.
- **Repetition of Key Phrases:**
    - "One song": Appears numerous times, central to the book's thesis.
    - "Inspiration": Frequently discussed, often in the context of it being "invited" or "overrated" as a passive force.
    - "Ego": A common subject, usually in the context of managing or sidestepping it.
    - "Process": Constantly emphasized as more important than the outcome.
