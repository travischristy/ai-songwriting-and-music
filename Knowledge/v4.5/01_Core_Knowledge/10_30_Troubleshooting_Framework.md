# Troubleshooting Framework: Diagnosing & Solving Common Songwriting Flaws

This document provides a systematic framework for diagnosing common songwriting problems by mapping them to failures in the core principles of The Addiction Formula (Hype, Tension, Implied Tension) and the PRA Method (Pattern, Repetition, Arc).

| **Common Symptom**                               | **Diagnosis (Failure of Core Principle)**                                                                                                                                                      | **Actionable Solution (Framework & Suno Tactic)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **"My song feels flat / has no energy."**        | **Insufficient Hype Contour:** The Hype value is stagnant and does not increase across sections (e.g., from verse to chorus).                                                                  | **Solution:** Engineer a clear Hype increase. <br/>Tac**tic: Us**e Suno prompts to add energy layers. Ex: [Ch`orus] ->` (po``                                                                                                                                                  |
| **"The second verse is boring."**                | **Failed Energy Reset & Lack of Implied Tension:** The energy drop after the first chorus is too abrupt, and no new lyrical information ("furniture") is introduced to re-engage the listener. | **Solution:** Manage the post-chorus energy valley and introduce a new question or detail. <br/>Tac**tic: Us**e tags to strip back the arrangement ((in`timate, sparse, palm-muted guitar)) a`nd add a specific lyrical line that advances the Song Map.                       |
| **"My chorus doesn't hit hard enough."**         | **Inadequate Tension Build-Up:** The pre-chorus fails to create sufficient tension, making the "release" into the chorus feel unearned and weak.                                               | **Solution:** Maximize the tension in the section immediately preceding the chorus. <br/>Tac**tic: Us**e pre-chorus prompts with tags like (ri`sing tension, building, crescendo, filtered drums, riser sfx) to` create anticipation.                                          |
| **"The song feels repetitive and predictable."** | **PRA Imbalance (Excess Repetition, Insufficient Arc):** The song's patterns are repeated without meaningful variation or forward momentum. The listener is never surprised.                   | **Solution:** Introduce a subtle pattern variation or a new element in the second half of the song. <br/>Tac**tic: In** [Ve`rse 2], a`dd a new counter-melody tag (fa`int, distant synth arp). I`n the [Br`idge], r`adically change the chord progression and instrumentation. |
| **"My lyrics sound generic / clichéd."**         | **Failure of Specificity (Lyrical Furniture):** The lyrics rely on abstract concepts instead of concrete, sensory details that make the scene unique.                                          | **Solution:** Replace abstract emotions with specific objects, actions, or sensory details. <br/>Tac**tic: In**stead of (sa`d lyrics), p`rompt with (ly``                                                                                                                      |
| **"The song feels disjointed / doesn't flow."**  | **Broken Pattern Cohesion (PRA):** Sections lack shared melodic or rhythmic DNA. The transition between parts is jarring.                                                                      | **Solution:** Ensure a core melodic or rhythmic motif is present (even if subtly) in most sections. <br/>Tac**tic: Sp**ecify a recurring instrument or rhythmic feel. Ex: (fu`nky bassline throughout) or` (co``                                                               |
| **"My bridge is weak and goes nowhere."**        | **Failure to Deviate & Re-Engage:** The bridge does not provide a significant departure from the established song structure, nor does it set up a powerful return to the final chorus.         | **Solution:** Use the bridge for maximum contrast and to ask the song's central question. <br/>Tac**tic: Pr**ompt a dramatic shift: [Br`idge] ->` (et``                                                                                                                        |
