# Prompting for Reimagine Song Lyrics Process



I'd want you to try another round where you dont alter the original lyrics so much. My main issue with the revised lyrics is that the words you used, while clever and aligned with the theme may not translate in song well due to their complexity and length, they detract from the "catchiness" factor.
When you reimagine the song this round:

- come up with new vocal hook
- songs with the same syllable count each line can sound robotic, they benefit from some variation bounded in a greater rhythmic pattern, for example if line 1 and 3 had 8 syllables and 2 and 4 had 11 (just an example off the top of my head, not an actual specific recommended pattern or count to use)
- try to humanize your lyrics a little more, introducing some unexpected language and abstract concepts/ideas/metaphors, inventing new terms, or add an extra line to a verse or mix up the song structure in an unexpected way... the suno ai is actually really good at making whatever is written work, so long as it is not completely disorganized or written with very little attention to song form/structure.
- add new and more frequent vocalizations, call backs, or echoes (though make sure they are timely and work as humanizing enhancements rather that seeming like they make the song "overcooked") -- for example how I did here:

```other
Look at that (mmm)
Beam me up, make it clap (Make it clap)
Space cheeks got me like that, like that (Like that)
Float it up in zero g's like that (Like that), eh
```

Use sequential thinking to plan and execute the song lyrics creative writing process.

When you provide the new lyrics, be sure to provide me with a final draft that is not marked or annotated, that is to say so they are made ready to be used and pasted into the Suno AI web app custom lyrics box.
