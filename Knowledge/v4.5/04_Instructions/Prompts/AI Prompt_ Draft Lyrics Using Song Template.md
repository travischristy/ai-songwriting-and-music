# AI Prompt: Draft Lyrics Using Song Template

**Goal:** Draft a complete set of song lyrics section by section, strictly adhering to the guidance, structure, and principles outlined in the provided Song Template. Prioritize implementing the most critical aspects identified for each section within the template.

**Inputs:**

1. **Song Template:** A detailed template (YAML or Markdown format, generated from previous analysis) outlining the structure, function, themes, imagery style, rhyme approach, rhythmic feel, patterns, tension levels, etc., for each song section. This will be provided immediately following this prompt.
2. **Overall Theme/Concept (Optional but Recommended):** A brief description of the central idea, story, or emotion for the *new* song being drafted.
3. **Keywords/Ideas (Optional):** Any specific phrases, images, or concepts the user wants to incorporate.

**Instructions for AI Assistant - Step-by-Step Drafting Process:**

1. **Step 1: Ingest and Internalize Template:**
    - Carefully read and parse the entire provided Song Template.
    - Identify all song sections and their sequence.
    - For each section, fully understand the specific guidance provided regarding: Function, Theme/Content, Imagery/Language Style, Rhyme Approach, Rhythm/Syllable Guidance, PRA Elements (Patterns/Repetition/Arc contribution), Tension/Hype Level, and any other specified techniques or constraints (e.g., cliché avoidance).
1. **Step 2: Identify Key Priorities Per Section:**
    - Before drafting each section, re-read its guidance in the template.
    - Determine the **1-3 most critical or emphasized instructions** for that specific section. (e.g., Is the template heavily stressing concrete imagery for Verse 1? Is strict rhyme the priority for the Chorus? Is repetition the main focus?). These are your primary objectives for that section.
1. **Step 3: Draft Section by Section (Sequential & Focused):**
    - Proceed through the song structure section by section, in the order defined by the template.
    - For the current section:
        - **Prioritize Implementation:** Focus *first* on satisfying the identified Key Priorities (from Step 2).
        - **Generate Draft Lines:** Create lyrics that attempt to fulfill *all* guidance points for the section (theme, imagery, rhyme, rhythm, etc.), while ensuring the Key Priorities are strongly met. Use the provided Overall Theme/Concept and Keywords/Ideas (if given) as source material.
        - **Match Function & Tone:** Ensure the drafted lines align with the section's specified Function (e.g., building tension, providing release) and target Tension/Hype Level.
        - **Internal Cliché Check:** Briefly cross-reference generated lines against common songwriting clichés (from your internal knowledge or provided lists) and attempt to use fresh language.
        - **Adhere to Patterns:** Implement any specific repetitions or structural patterns mandated by the template for this section.
1. **Step 4: Review Transitions (Briefly):**
    - After drafting all sections, quickly read through the entire lyric set.
    - Check the transitions *between* sections for basic logical and emotional coherence. Make minor wording adjustments ONLY if necessary to smooth out jarring transitions, without significantly altering the content drafted according to the template guidance.
1. **Step 5: Output Final Draft:**
    - Present the complete drafted lyrics.
    - Clearly label each section according to the names used in the Song Template (e.g., Verse 1, Refrain, Chorus).

**Output Format:** The final output should be the drafted song lyrics, formatted clearly with section labels.
