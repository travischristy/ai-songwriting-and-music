# **Suno AI Music Generation: A Deep Dive into Metatags and Music Styling**

Suno AI is an innovative platform that has revolutionized music creation through artificial intelligence. It allows users to generate unique songs by providing text prompts that describe the desired style and lyrics. Suno AI is designed to create unique background music for videos, podcasts, and social media content1. You can use it to create music for your videos, podcasts, and social media content, such as YouTube videos, Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, Podcasts, and more1. Forget AI playlists; this will allow you to create your own Thanksgiving song list where each song is customized for a member of your family visiting2. While the platform's basic functionality is relatively straightforward, there's a deeper layer of control that can be achieved through the use of "metatags" within the custom lyrics input. These metatags provide a way to guide the AI in terms of song structure, instrumentation, and other musical elements. This article delves into the world of Suno AI metatags, exploring their capabilities and limitations, particularly with the latest V4 model.

## **Understanding Suno AI and Metatags**

Suno AI employs a combination of transformer and diffusion models to generate music based on user input3. Users can provide a brief description of the desired music style (up to 200 characters) using keywords for genre, emotion, and energy. In addition, they can input custom lyrics (up to 3000 characters) to further shape the generated song. Within these lyrics, users can embed metatags enclosed in square brackets (e.g., "", "", ""). These metatags act as signals to the AI, influencing various aspects of the music.

Suno AI offers several key features and improvements, particularly in its latest V4 model:

    - Incorrect: (Verse: Soft vocals) or {Verse: Soft vocals}

## **Effectiveness and Limitations of Metatags**

Metatags can be powerful tools for shaping the output of Suno AI, but their effectiveness can be inconsistent. The AI's interpretation of these tags can vary, and the results may not always align perfectly with the user's intentions7. It's essential to approach metatag usage with a degree of experimentation and understand that achieving the desired outcome might involve some trial and error8.

### **Factors Influencing Effectiveness**

Some factors that can influence the effectiveness of metatags include:

- **The complexity of the tag:** Simple tags with a maximum of three words tend to be more effective9.
- **The genre of music:** Certain instrumental tags might work better within specific genres7.
- **The overall context of the lyrics and style prompt:** The AI considers the entire input, and metatags work in conjunction with the other elements. A clear and concise style prompt provides a strong foundation for effective metatag usage10.
- **Descriptive style words and musical terms:** You can add descriptive style words (e.g., "sad verse," "happy chorus") or musical terms (e.g., "rap verse," "power pop chorus") within metatags to guide the AI on how lyrics should be sung and the musical style of specific sections8.

### **Limitations of Metatags**

While metatags can significantly enhance the music creation process, they have limitations:

- **No guarantee of specific outcomes:** Metatags provide guidance, not absolute control. The AI might interpret them in unexpected ways.
- **Limited influence on certain aspects:** For example, while you can suggest a tempo or BPM, the AI ultimately determines the final tempo based on the overall style and genre12.
- **Potential for being ignored or sung:** If a metatag is too complex or doesn't fit the context, the AI might ignore it or even incorporate it into the lyrics9. For example, attempting to create a "call and response" effect between instruments using a metatag like "" might not be reliable9.

It's important to remember that metatag usage often requires experimentation and iteration to achieve the desired results8. The effectiveness of metatags can be unpredictable and inconsistent, so it's crucial to manage expectations and understand that they don't offer absolute control over the AI8.

## **Best Practices for Using Metatags**

To maximize the effectiveness of metatags in Suno AI, consider these best practices:

- **Keep it simple:** Use concise tags with a maximum of three words9.
- **Be specific:** Use descriptive terms that clearly convey your intention.
- **Experiment:** Try different combinations of tags and observe how the AI responds.
- **Use metatags strategically:** Consider the genre, mood, and overall structure of your song when placing metatags. Metatags are most effective when used sparingly and strategically9.
- **Combine metatags with other Suno AI features:** Features like "Scenes" and "Replace Section" can further enhance your control over the generated music13. The "Replace Section" feature allows you to fine-tune up to 30 seconds of your songs13.
- **Don't overload with metatags:** Too many metatags can clutter your lyrics and confuse the AI.
- **Add ad-libs within lyrics:** This can create a more natural flow in the vocal delivery14.
- **Use external tools:** Tools like Musify can be used to change the singing voice or create duets by separating and manipulating the vocal and instrumental tracks14.

## **Conclusion**

Metatags in Suno AI provide a valuable tool for refining and customizing AI-generated music, allowing users to shape various musical elements. However, it's important to approach metatag usage with a clear understanding of their capabilities and limitations. By keeping tags concise, specific, and strategically placed, users can increase their effectiveness. Experimentation and iteration are key to achieving desired outcomes, as the AI's interpretation of metatags can be unpredictable. Combining metatags with other Suno AI features like "Scenes" and "Replace Section" can further enhance creative control. While metatags offer a degree of influence, they don't provide absolute control over the AI. Ultimately, Suno AI empowers users to explore new creative avenues and generate unique musical compositions.

Meta tags are powerful tools used within the custom lyrics box to guide the AI in structuring the song:

- **Structural Tags**: Use tags like [Intro], [Verse], [Chorus], and [Outro] to define song sections[1].
- **Instrumental Tags**: Tags like [Guitar solo] or [Synth break] instruct the AI to include specific instrumental elements[1].
- **Vocal Tags**: Use [Female Vocal] or [Male Vocal] to specify the desired voice type[1].
- **Dynamic Elements**: Tags like [Catchy Hook] or [Emotional Bridge] emphasize certain parts of the song[1].

### Formatting Guidelines

- Keep meta tags simple, using a maximum of three words per tag[5].
- Place meta tags in square brackets, e.g., [Verse] or [Chorus][1].
- Avoid using explicit content or copyrighted material in your prompts[3].

## Style of Music Input

The "style of music" input box allows users to specify the genre, mood, and overall musical characteristics of the desired composition.

### Genre Tags

Use specific genre tags to define the musical style:

- Examples: Ambient, Jazz Fusion, EDM, Folk Rock[4]

### Mood Descriptors

Provide emotional and stylistic qualities:

- Examples: Atmospheric, Melancholy, Upbeat, Calming[4]

### Instrumentation

Specify desired instruments and arrangement details:

- Examples: Clean electric guitar, Synthesizers, Ambient pads, Subtle percussion[4]

### Tempo and Rhythm

Define the pace and rhythmic feel:

- Examples: Largo: 40-60 BPM, Allegro: 120-168 BPM[4]

## Prompting Best Practices

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Clearly specify desired attributes to avoid ambiguity[4].
2. **Conciseness**: Balance detail with brevity to avoid overly complex prompts[4].
3. **Experimentation**: Test different structures and refine based on the output[4].
4. **Combine Elements**: Mix genre tags, mood descriptors, and instrumentation for more precise results[4].

## Limitations and Considerations

- The AI's interpretation of prompts can be unpredictable, so multiple attempts might be needed[1].
- Recent restrictions have been placed on explicit language and certain words[3].
- The AI may not always follow meta tags exactly as specified[5].

When using multiple tags for a specific part of a song in Suno AI, it's generally recommended to keep the tags simple and organized. Here's

# How you should structure and organize multiple tags:

## Single Bracket Approach

The most common and effective method is to combine related tags within a single set of brackets:

- Use a maximum of three words per tag[1][4].
- Separate multiple tags with a hyphen or space.

Examples:

- `[Verse - Whispered]`
- `[Chorus - High Energy]`
- `[Bridge Emotional Acoustic]`

This approach allows you to specify both the structural element and its characteristics concisely.

## Multiple Tag Combinations

For more complex instructions, you can use multiple tagged elements in sequence:

- `[Intro][Guitar Solo]`
- `[Verse][Female Vocal][Soft]`
- `[Chorus][Catchy Hook][Build Up]`

This method helps in providing more detailed instructions while keeping each tag focused and specific.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: Avoid overcomplicating with too many tags[5].
2. **Be specific**: Pair a brief style description with a noun indicating the instrument or voice[1].
3. **Prioritize clarity**: Ensure each tag clearly communicates its intended effect.

Remember that while these tagging methods can guide the AI, Suno's interpretation can be unpredictable[3]. Experimentation may be necessary to achieve desired results.
