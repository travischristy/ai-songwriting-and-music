# Reference Sheet_ Song Sections and Structures by Genre_Style

This reference sheet defines common song sections and outlines typical structural patterns, noting genres where they are frequently found. Remember that these are common tendencies, and artists often blend or break these conventions.

**I. Common Song Sections & Their Functions**

- **Intro:**
    - **Function:** Establishes mood, tempo, key; often introduces a core musical motif or hook. Can be instrumental or include vocal elements. (Mentioned in Creating More Effective Songs with Suno.md, SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Verse:**
    - **Function:** Develops the song's narrative, characters, or situation; provides details and context. Typically repeats musically but with different lyrics each time. Lower energy than the chorus. (Mentioned in Creating More Effective Songs with Suno.md, SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Pre-Chorus:**
    - **Function:** Builds tension and anticipation leading into the Chorus. Often features a melodic lift or harmonic shift. Connects the Verse and Chorus smoothly. (Mentioned in SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Chorus:**
    - **Function:** Contains the main theme, message, and primary hook of the song. Typically the most energetic and memorable section, repeated multiple times with the same (or very similar) lyrics and music. (Mentioned in Creating More Effective Songs with Suno.md, SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Post-Chorus:**
    - **Function:** A brief section following the Chorus, often extending its energy or providing a transition. Can contain a secondary hook or motif.
- **Bridge:**
    - **Function:** Provides contrast (lyrical perspective, melody, harmony, rhythm) to the Verse and Chorus. Usually appears once, offering a departure before a final return to the Chorus. (Mentioned in Creating More Effective Songs with Suno.md, SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Refrain:**
    - **Function:** A recurring line or short phrase (often the title or key message) that repeats periodically, frequently at the end of verses. Shorter and usually less energetic than a full Chorus. Can exist alongside or instead of a Chorus. (Mentioned in SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Hook:**
    - **Function:** The most memorable "catchy" element (lyrical or musical). Often part of the Chorus, but can be anywhere (Intro riff, key line). Designed to grab attention. (Mentioned in SunoAI-wiki.md tag list)
- **Instrumental Break / Solo / Interlude:**
    - **Function:** A section without main vocals, focusing on instrumentation. Provides contrast, showcases musicianship, shifts mood. (Mentioned in SunoAI-wiki.md tag list)
- **Outro / Ending:**
    - **Function:** Provides closure. Can fade out, repeat a motif, end abruptly, or offer a final statement. (Mentioned in Creating More Effective Songs with Suno.md, SunoAI-wiki.md)
- **Ad-libs / Vocalizations:**
    - **Function:** Short, often improvised vocal sounds or phrases adding personality, emphasis, or rhythmic texture. (Mentioned in SunoAI-wiki.md)

| **Verse-Chorus**           | V1 - C - V2 - C - B - C - Outro            | The most common structure in popular music. Verses develop story/details, Chorus provides main theme/hook, Bridge offers contrast. | Pop, Rock, Country, Hip-Hop, R&B, Electronic, Folk-Rock                  |
| **Verse-Refrain**          | V1 - R - V2 - R - V3 - R - Outro           | Verses tell a story or present ideas, with a recurring short Refrain reinforcing the core message or title. Lacks a full Chorus.   | Folk, Singer-Songwriter, Ballads, Hymns, Storytelling Songs              |

| **Verse-PreChorus-Chorus** | V-PC-C-V-PC-C-B-C...                       | Adds a Pre-Chorus section before each Chorus to build anticipation and create a smoother energy ramp-up.                           | Pop, Rock, Contemporary R&B, Christian Contemporary Music (CCM)          |
| **With Post-Chorus**       | V-C-PC-V-C-PC-B-C-PC...                    | Includes a short section after the Chorus, often reinforcing the hook or providing a transition.                                   | Pop, Electronic Dance Music (EDM), Rock                                  |
| **Chorus-Centered**        | C - V1 - C - V2 - B - C...                 | Starts with the Chorus or features it very heavily with shorter verses.                                                            | Pop, Dance, EDM, some Hip-Hop                                            |
| **12-Bar Blues**           | (AAB lyrical structure over I-IV-V chords) | Specific chord progression (I-I-I-I / IV-IV-I-I / V-IV-I-V) often with AAB lyrical pattern per cycle. Structure is cyclic.         | Blues, Rock & Roll, Jazz, some Country                                   |
| **Through-Composed**       | A - B - C - D - E ...                      | Minimal or no repetition of major sections. Continuously introduces new musical and lyrical material.                              | Progressive Rock, Art Rock, Classical Music, some Musical Theater        |

**Why Vary Structure?**

- **Genre Conventions:** Some genres have strongly associated structures (like 12-Bar Blues).
- **Narrative Needs:** A complex story might benefit from more verses or a through-composed approach.
- **Emotional Arc:** The desired build-up and release of tension influences section order and type (e.g., adding a Pre-Chorus enhances the Chorus impact).
- **Memorability vs. Complexity:** Verse-Chorus is highly memorable; AABA offers contrast; Through-composed offers complexity.
- **Artistic Choice:** Breaking conventions creates uniqueness and surprise.
