# Suno v5 Migration – Knowledge Base Wide Plan

**Repo:** travischristy/ai-songwriting-and-music  
**Legacy KB:** `Knowledge/v4.5/**`  
**New KB scaffold:** `Knowledge/v5.0/**`  
**Canonical v5 sources:** `v5.0 Migration Reference/Latest Knowledge/**`


## KNOWLEDGE BASE INVENTORY AND DATA WRANGLING

Analyze Existing v4.5 Inventory and Create Index of Outdated References:

1. Create a full knowledge base file inventory table and file tree

2. Explore the existing knowledge and create a topic modeling / subject matter table to gain a better understanding of its contents for downstream restructuring and edits/updates/additions

3. Search/Scan all text for instances where a previous model instance is used (v4.5, v4.5+, v4, v3.5 etc) to create an index of all potentially outdated/deprecated content found in `Knowledge/v4.5/`

4. Label index with proposed change to either update the knowledge in accordance with the new v5.0 information or divorce suno model implications / references from knowledge that is not Suno AI model relevant / dependent. The goal is to prioritize updating knowledge where the suno model capabilities / limitations / specifics directly correlate to the knowledge subject matter. Where knowledge can exist agnostic to the suno ai model best practices / capabilities / specifics it is better not to list specific model versions or content that can be later deprecated by a future change / update. 

5. Update knowledge inventory based on the results of the indexing and changes assessment to facilitate the migration process next steps.
