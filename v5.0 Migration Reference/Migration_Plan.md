# Suno v5 Migration – Knowledge Base Wide Plan

**Repo:** travischristy/ai-songwriting-and-music  
**Legacy KB:** `Knowledge/v4.5/**`  
**New KB scaffold:** `Knowledge/v5.0/**`  
**Canonical v5 sources:** `v5.0 Migration Reference/Latest Knowledge/**`

## Goals
- Replace Suno v4.5 (and earlier) guidance with Suno v5 across `Knowledge/v5.0/**`.
- Update capabilities, prompting best practices, parameters/controls, length/Extend, negatives/exclusions, mixing notes, genre guidance, troubleshooting, FAQs, and examples.
- Preserve model-agnostic content; move v4.5-only notes to **Deprecated**.

## Scope (non-negotiable)
- Rename model references where technically correct: `Suno v4.5|v4|v3` → `Suno v5`.
- Remove obsolete v4.5 workarounds; add v5-specific techniques and examples.
- Evidence-tag any numbers/limits changed: `[Source: <file> §<heading>]`.

## File Targets
- **Include:** `Knowledge/v5.0/**/*.md`
- **Exclude:** `Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/**`, `Knowledge/v5.0/06_Datesets/**`, `**/archive/**`, `**/images/**`, `**/assets/**`
