The word Tresillo comes from the Spanish word meaning triplet or three equal notes in the span of two beats. I started thinking about a song I'd heard on the radio, featuring a guitar strum vamping on the same pattern. It hit me that maybe singers use this in song melodies.

Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Mastering Melody Writing꞉ A Songwriter’s Guide to Hookier Songs with Pattern, Repetition, and Arc [Transcript].md:321:Likewise, memorizing great songs will help build and expand your musical vocabulary. I say you should focus on the hit songs because these songs have proven catchy and therefore have used the line plus pattern in a good way. Tapping into line plus. Our songwriting brains often get stuck in our usual patterns. One way to change these patterns is to drop out the melody chords and lyrics and simply tap out a rhythm to which you can write. Try tapping out a rhythm and end with a pause and then three clustered taps. Do this a few times until you have that pattern down. You may have to record it and listen to the rhythm again and again to get out of your old grooves.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Mastering Melody Writing꞉ A Songwriter’s Guide to Hookier Songs with Pattern, Repetition, and Arc [Transcript].md:331:If the song has lyrics that have three syllables, even better.

You're probably more suited to be a topliner. Topliners work with the track person adding melody and lyrics on top of the musical track. In modern co-writes, there can be more than one top-liner on a song. In my songwriting session for Beautiful Mess, all of us were top-liners because we top-lined over a drum loop on my computer.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Mastering Melody Writing꞉ A Songwriter’s Guide to Hookier Songs with Pattern, Repetition, and Arc [Transcript].md:413:Often in a co-write, one top-liner or writer creates the melody and the other writes the lyrics, or each does a little of both.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers did this successfully with their song Give It Away. I did this in my co-written song Fall, which was a hit in both Country for Clay Walker and Adult Contemporary for Kimberly Locke. We wanted to create a hook with the word fall by sprinkling it throughout the chorus, using it a different way each time.

Songs have what I call hot spots. These are places in a melody that naturally draw in the listener like a moth to a flame. Hot spots can be utilized to add extra hookiness and emotion to songs by infusing the lyrics with rhythmic repetitions, rhyme repetitions, and melody pattern repetitions.

The goal is to create memorable melodic hotspots in the same places as your important lyrics. If you find it too hard to change an existing song, work through this same process with a new song before you lock into a final melody. Bill has one hotspot trick he likes to do to punch up his song's title. He breaks up the rhythm of how he sings the title by putting rests or beats in between the words of the title.

He said he was really into the latest Maroon 5 album. him. Instantly I knew what I had to do. I knew from my own inspired listening sessions that the lead singer Adam Levine often utilized interval jumps when writing melodies for his band. So I started singing a verse melody that employed some wide interval jumps. I love that, Ryan said. By the end of the writing session, we had a song that truly fired him up and one he felt would really showcase his heart and vocals.

So, your melody should be interesting enough to keep the listener's attention and simple enough that it's memorable.

Lyrically, we didn't need more than a single line, so we let that guide the melody. While writing the second verse, Darius thought the prior pre-chorus was exceptionally hooky. So, along with our co-writer Frank Rogers, we decided not only to repeat the same melody, but also to repeat the lyric as well. Since it was a single line, it felt hooky. If it had been four lines, the song would have screamed for new lyrics. Pre-choruses are fun sections of a song because there's a lot of flexibility for placement. Some songs leave the pre-chorus out of the second verse, but then return to it later in the song as a pseudo-bridge.

Although a subtle point, this can make a song less interesting to the ear. Most professional songwriters do this intuitively, but they also deliberately change things when there is too much repetition in a song.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Mastering Melody Writing꞉ A Songwriter’s Guide to Hookier Songs with Pattern, Repetition, and Arc [Transcript].md:785:Put it into practice. As you practice your inspired listening, tap and count along with the beat of the songs. Notice on which beat of the bar the verse vocals begin and on which beat the choruses begin. Be aware of how your favorite songs vary the vocal entrances to create contrast between sections. Next, listen to a few of your songs. If you start each section on the same beat, try changing it up.

Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:351:This is why we will only develop titles to their full potential if we organise ideas into their most powerful order, a writable idea, and then turn them into amazing lyrics that genuinely touch people when they hear the finished song.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:401:Summary. In this chapter, we've covered why we need to honour every idea, why the flow of ideas is important in writing lyrics, the songwriter's secret weapon and the fundamental concepts that make up song mapping.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:431:Opposites are also helpful in building title possibilities. This is where you combine a negative word or phrase with a positive word or phrase. In the past, I've even used a spreadsheet to generate random combinations until I found one that really resonates. For example, born crucified. My friend and fantastic lyricist Gina Boe has a knack for finding these. For example, Mendisa's Broken Hallelujah and Love Like a Thorn. Also, look at the Civil War's Poison and Wine.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:433:These are inspiring titles, even before hearing the song, and there are many places titles like these can go. And it's wonderful to hear them crafted into such beautiful lyrics.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:435:Other possible sources include unfinished lyrics, key words in other songs, iTunes, films, books, TV shows, radio chat shows, devotions, conversations, yours or other people's, journaling.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:453:a. Create a structure. Writing a heading for each section with the map heading next to it. The song maps in the next chapter will give you the various headings, e.g. verse 1, how the tension is sensed, chorus 1, the response, Make sure to leave room to add a few phrases or sentences, not lyrics, to describe what the section will say.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:455:b. Summarise each section Underneath each section, use a few words to say what ideas you would like to assign to that section. The key here is to be brief. If specific lyrics come to mind, that's fine, get them down, but writing lyrics is not the focus of this part of the process.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:503:One, not all titles make great lyrics. While I promise you can write any title with SongMaps, i.e. turn any title into a coherent lyric, I can't guarantee they will all be great lyrics.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:505:The fact is, some titles are more writable than others and will produce better lyrics than others, and that's why we need song maps, to figure out where on the scale of writable and unwritable the title sits before it's too late.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:515:That part of the crafting process is still very individual and down to you to develop in your own way. 4. Crafting Still Matters When you apply the techniques in this book, it's tempting to think that a mechanical process will work every time. That's certainly not the case. Without a doubt, this process will help you write better songs, but of course, every song needs carefully crafting, so please do bear in mind the other elements needed to create authentic, genuine lyrics that use appropriate language, phrasing, prosody, lyrics to music, consistent rhyme schemes, etc., because they all hugely matter and will be essential to you in crafting your best songs.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:547:Every time you listen to a song on the radio or on iTunes, there is an implied flow of ideas embedded in the lyric. I'd like to say every successful song is a great example of well-crafted lyrics, but, of course, reality is not like that.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:549:There are many reasons why songs appear on the radio. However, I'd go as far as to say any really successful lyric-driven song, which generally fall within the genres of country, pop, contemporary Christian music, CCM, Southern Gospel, worship, musicals and jazz, is more likely to have some strong lyrical development than not, and these can be plotted on a song Again, I offer this approach not as rules, which have to be followed, but as tools, which with a little upfront investment in terms of time, will help you write your very best songs.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:557:The draft lyrics I have written for the purposes of illustrating the maps here are basic lyrics aimed at illustrating the respective map, rather than crafting a Grammy winner.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:569:It's particularly helpful to have in your toolkit because it lends itself to virtually any lyrically driven genre, pop, country, basically any genre of love song, Christian contemporary, southern gospel, musicals and jazz, and all songs that seek to move people.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:661:1. Is it as singable as it needs to be? Repetition is particularly helpful if you are looking to write an anthemic song. 2. What is the problem that prompts the burst of emotion that is declared in the chorus? This is your verse 1 idea. 3. What is the natural, authentic response to the emotion behind the declaration of the chorus? This is your verse 2 idea. 4. What does all this mean? In other words, having gone through the journey from problem, declaration, response, are there any natural consequences? Has anything changed? In what way will life be different now?

Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:713:CCM, Overcomer by Mandisa is a superb problem declaration song and is a great song to work to, partly because of the tempo and partly because of the message. Verse 1 starts with the problem, staring at a stop sign, nothing going right. The pre-chorus introduces God's purpose is greater before the chorus blasts out the message and the title, you're an overcomer. Verse 2 turns to sympathize that everyone's been there and he wants you to know.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:733:On the declaratory chorus, nothing's. Verse 2 is the response to the chorus, if the road is not so easy, with a nice simile thrown in, like a guiding star. Nice work by writers Jerry Goffin and Michael Massa penning an adult contemporary song turned into jazz by Benson.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:777:I had a melody first, which I was keen to set the lyric to, a 6-8 mid-tempo country sounding song. I wrote the lyric over a number of months before showcasing it and tweaking slightly afterwards.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:883:I'm thinking Taylor's country, lyric-driven roots helped her with this as a crossover artist. Other classic pop lyrics you may like to look at include Amarillo by Tony Christie, which despite its comedic association with P.D.K., is actually well written.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:891:Southern Gospel Sometimes it takes a mountain, by the Gaither vocal band, moves through different places of a metaphor, from facing a mountain, in verse 1, to a place of surrender, in verse 2, and the acknowledgement in each chorus that sometimes that's what it takes to get a hold of me.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:983:If a genuine common thread can't be traced through the whole song, there is a risk the twist could sound contrived, cheesy, or just plain funny. The twist is great for genres that rely on a strong, traditionally crafted lyric—country, southern gospel, musicals, or jazz—applying Twist to genres with more conversational lyrics, pop or worship, would need the Twist to be more subtle.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:1053:Musical, for good, from the musical Wicked. Some of the best crafting of lyrics can be found in musicals because they have to move the plot forward. This is a lovely use of a phrase twist to nail a song's title, as well as it hitting a characters singing this duet, confirming the positive impact each one has on the other.

You now have An understanding of the benefits of writing with song maps an understanding of what to do when ideas come at any moment during the day or night, the songwriter's secret weapon to writing moving lyrics, a four-step process to start writing with song maps, seven song maps to apply to your writing, an approach to writing with each song map, and the foundation to start building your idea bank of writable ideas and, if you've completed the exercises in the song map workbook, you have seven writable ideas to take into your next writing session or co-write.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:1163:Song mapping is a way of stealing like an artist in your lyric writing without anyone knowing. However, this comes with a health warning. Mapping the lyrics of songs you love can sometimes totally ruin your enjoyment of them. This happens to me a lot. While I still love the songs, song maps help me understand more about why I love them. Maybe for the melody, harmonies, the idea behind the lyric, even though it could be crafted better, or maybe the artistry of the artist.

Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:1243:Chapter 7, Outro With this book, I've tried to pass on a writing technique I discovered many years ago that completely transformed the way I write lyrics. I hope and pray that it will be as useful to you as it has been and continues to be for me.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:1261:Verse 2. How the solution is sensed. I'd like to twitch my nose and it'll all be gone. I'd love to upload it to [www.upwork.com](http://www.upwork.com) and get it back done, or hire a housekeeper to sort it out, and all the other things waiting for her. But in the end, it's easier to just take it to my mum, who's been, chorus, the response. Ironing forever. Ironing forever. I have better things to do with my life than ironing forever.

She folds my shirts just the way I like them to fit in my drawer. She even irons my handkerchiefs, ties, and underwear. She's got all the sprays, the starch and stuff, and a heavy-duty iron that will go on and on and on and on. That's why she doesn't mind, chorus the response, ironing forever, ironing forever. I have better things to do with my life than ironing forever. Like I said in chapter four, while I honestly believe you can write any title with song maps, not all titles make great lyrics.
Knowledge/v5.0/03_Expert_Songwriter_Books/Song-Maps-A-New-System-to-Write-Your-Best-Lyrics.md:1285:For example, Matt Redmond's Blessed Be Your Name and Chris Tomlin's Amazing Grace, My Chains Fell Off. Musical 1 problem declaration, 2 roles, 3 tension response. By definition, the lyrics of a song in a musical need to move the overall plot of the show forward, so it is no surprise that we find some very strong writing in this genre of music.
