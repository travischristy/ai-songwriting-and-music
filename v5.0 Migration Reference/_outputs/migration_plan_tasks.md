# Migration Plan Tasks (Verbatim Extract)

Source: `v5.0 Migration Reference/Migration_Plan.md`

1. Search/Scan all text for instances where a previous model instance is used (v4.5, v4.5+, v4, v3.5 etc) to create an index of all potentially outdated/deprecated content found in `Knowledge/v4.5/`.
2. Label index with proposed change to either update the knowledge in accordance with the new v5.0 information or divorce suno model implications / references from knowledge that is not Suno AI model relevant / dependent. The goal is to prioritize updating knowledge where the suno model capabilities / limitations / specifics directly correlate to the knowledge subject matter. Where knowledge can exist agnostic to the suno ai model best practices / capabilities / specifics it is better not to list specific model versions or content that can be later deprecated by a future change / update.
3. Update knowledge inventory based on the results of the indexing and changes assessment to facilitate the migration process next steps.
