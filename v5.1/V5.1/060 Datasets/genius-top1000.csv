Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better‚Ä¶

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better‚Ä¶

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre

Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake

Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?

The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life

Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. is some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real Gs
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh

Little Mu', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!
[Verse 4: Kadafi]
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker

I see them, they run, hahahaha

How the fuck they gonna be the mob

Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?

Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!

Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion

And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!

Smokin' weed in Bamb√∫, sippin' on Private Stock

With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far

I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood

Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us

And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‚ÄòCause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‚Äòcause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan‚ÄîP.S. We should be together too
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word‚ÄîI don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now‚ÄîI'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together‚Äîthink about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim‚Äîshut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up‚Äîsee? I ain't like you
‚ÄòCause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot‚Äîhow am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was‚Äîit was you

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)‚Äã‚Äã
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass‚Äîyou asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said‚Ä¶ nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals‚Äîwell, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes‚Äî

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas

Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day, you just up and leave

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,rap,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,1992,2476629,{},"[Verse 1]
Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

[Verse 2]
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air
[Verse 3]
Well, uh
The plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!""

[Verse 4]
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie ""Yo', Holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air",20444,en,en,en

Till I Collapse,rap,Eminem,2002,2447887,"{""Nate Dogg""}","[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‚ÄòCause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr√© from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney ‚Äî Nate, hit me!
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‚ÄòCause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‚ÄòCause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg, Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs

In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A.¬†

'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 5]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave""

Love the Way You Lie,rap,Eminem,2010,2306127,{Rihanna},"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it ‚Äî ""Wait!
Where you going?"" ‚Äî ""I'm leaving you!"" ‚Äî ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" ‚Äî We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna‚Äî
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it

What you cryin' about?

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie‚ÄîUncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum‚Äîsee, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Momma's only gone for the moment
[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)",1797,en,en,en

If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9

It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not‚Äî
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted

Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo‚Äînow;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" ‚Äî the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45‚Äôs and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Mo√´ts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery

Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off

But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke

Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe

If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all

Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
[Chorus: Talent]
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Talent]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is

(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same

Aww, yeah (Hear me)

That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Talent]
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is
[Chorus: Talent & 2Pac]
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm‚Äî

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up

But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was

He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up
[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up",826,en,en,en

You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‚Äòcause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‚Äòcause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‚ÄòCause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

Oh, yeah‚Äî it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor‚Äî
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope‚Äî
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube‚Äî
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done without Va‚Äî Va‚Äî Va‚Äî Va‚Äî Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles‚Äî
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to

Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles‚Äî

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet‚Äî
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Bridge: Paul Rodgers, Eminem]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own (Oh)
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (So)
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin'g to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you (So)

[Outro: Eminem]
Yeah
To my babies:
Stay strong
Your Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world:
God gave you shoes
To fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't never let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful (So-oh-oh-oh-oh)",545,en,en,en
Straight Outta Compton,rap,N.W.A,1988,1625352,{},"[Intro: Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‚ÄòCause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

[Interlude 1: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‚Äòcause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
[Interlude 2: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all on his dick in the first place, yeah. So run that shit, E, yeah.""

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said, ""My man JD is on freebase""
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car trying to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck-head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know, I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
Niggas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I bombed on pops, knocked his ol' ass out

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now I'm rolling hard, now under control
Then wrapped the '64 'round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh, brother
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walking home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 5: Eazy-E]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
My niggas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out, ""Fire,"" then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl, but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

Cleanin Out My Closet,rap,Eminem,2002,1616362,{},"[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‚ÄòCause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‚ÄòCause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of M√ºnchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead‚Äîdead to you as can be!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks

No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'
[Chorus]
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

[Outro]
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know
Queens get the money

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Martin]
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus 2: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On the bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect, but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

You love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like a AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it

I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?

I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh

Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?

Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go

Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame

Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)

Billie Jean,pop,Michael Jackson,1982,1529577,{},"[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)

Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out

We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?

I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle

And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous

I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited

How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing

Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh

Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

When Im Gone,rap,Eminem,2005,1494728,{},"[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
""But baby, wait!"" ‚Äì ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, kid, keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice

My Name Is,rap,Eminem,1999,1464039,{},"[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off
[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?

Break 'em
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day
[Outro]
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?",237,en,en,en

Where Is the Love?,rap,Black Eyed Peas,2003,1461202,"{""Justin Timberlake""}","[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
[Post-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?

'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Dear Mama,rap,2Pac,1995,1460491,{},"[Intro]
You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness

You should be honored by my lateness

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]

I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‚ÄòCause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills‚ÄîI pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Shit, look at the way you treat me

Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth

Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Aliz√© with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out

Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent

A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks

You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)

Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy

Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three

Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)

My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me

Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‚Äòcause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‚Äòcause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years

Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.

Still, still doin' that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E.

Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?

Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews

Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero

Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind

Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‚Äòcause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‚Äòcause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil ‚Äî spell it backwards, I'll show ya

It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like
Tryin' to start over, I got a hole in my heart

Gonna be that one? And then once we get 'em, it's never the same

Soon as they do, feelings change

I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?

Left, right, left, we all fall down

Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause‚Äî

Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated‚Äîit ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience

Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough

Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet, it's Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got-uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanish
Why in my world would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‚ÄòCause I don't write shit, ‚Äòcause I ain't got time
‚ÄòCause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em

You pop 'em ‚Äòcause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

I said a hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see, I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
A to the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang-bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang-bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, a but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank, come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money a than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again
[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
A Master Gee, a my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, a right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
A come alive, y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just a wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock-rock, y'all, a get on the floor
[Chorus: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Chorus: Master Gee]
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind
I said a 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, a get on the floor
A come alive, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
Said a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-a-hop and you don't stop rockin'
To the bang-bang, the boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
A-skiddlee bebop, we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America, we love you
A 'cause ya rock and a roll with a so much soul
You could rock 'til you're hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we're like hot butter on a breakfast toast
We rock it up, a baby bubba
Baby bubba to the boogie, the bang-bang, the boogie
To the beat, beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
A hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop
A rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I say I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
A just blow your mind so a that you can't speak
A do a thing, but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, a sing that song
A to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang-bang, the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, a with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said ""I go by the name Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
A just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, a don't stop, y'all, a tick a tock, y'all, you don't stop

[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
It go, ""Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was twelve o'clock a one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling alright
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now, the group ya hear is called Phase 2
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a cutting the jams and making it freak
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down and make ya rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something, there's still one fact
That to have a party, got to have a rap
So when the party's over you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping, you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase 2 a just a doing the do
Rocking ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
A come alive, girls, a get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on until the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
A come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
I say, a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat, beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
A so you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull""
A so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
But while the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh, so you say that's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
Oh, so you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend a two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby bubba, but we're still friends""

[Chorus: Wonder Mike]
A with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Chorus: Wonder Mike]
I said, ""A Hank, a can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
A can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""A come on, make, m-make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go toot the horns and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from '66 to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you've heard
I didn't even bite, not a god**** word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat-beat y'all
A lets rock, y'all, ya don't stop

[Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
It go, ""Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go, ""Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn""
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends

[Post-Chorus: Big Bank Hank]
A like that, y'all, a to the beat, y'all
A beat-beat, y'all, ya don't stop
A Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well, like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
A like the Bar-Kays singing ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds I throw down, a they're played the most
Just a like my man, a Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
A get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
A to the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, a get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Bar-Kays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doing the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
'Cause with the Master Gee, it's all the way live
At the age of six, I was a picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven
Don't ya know I went off?
I gotta run on down to the beat, you see
Getting right on down, making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat, the beat
To the double beat-beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was a really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine I was a right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
We're going on and on, and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on, and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A going on and on, and don't ya dare stop
A rock-rock, y'all, a gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite freak's delight
They call me the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Outro: Master Gee]
I'm gonna move ya here, I'm gonna move ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shocks your mind
I'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind
Said, just rock it to the east and move it to the west
Move it toward the lady you love-love the best
Master Gee, get it on
Taggin' all the girls, goin' down

Through the Wire,rap,Kanye West,2003,1228114,{},"[Produced by Kanye West]

[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the‚Ä¶
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like‚Ä¶ I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe

I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‚Äòcause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man",238,en,en,en
Lifes a Bitch,rap,Nas,1994,1225050,{AZ},"[Produced by L.E.S. & Nas]

[Intro: AZ and Nas]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‚ÄòCause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‚ÄòCause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‚Äòcause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‚ÄòCause life's a bitch and then you die
[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‚Äòcause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‚Äòcause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‚ÄòCause you never know when you're gonna go

Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand

You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man

Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)

99 Problems,rap,JAY-Z,2003,1216032,{},"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one ‚Äì hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one ‚Äì hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‚ÄòCause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one ‚Äì hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one ‚Äì hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‚Äòcause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one ‚Äì hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one ‚Äì hit me!

How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?

Sing for the Moment,rap,Eminem,2002,1177104,{},"[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‚Äòcause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‚Äòcause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‚Äòcause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can‚Äî

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night

Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing

Dance with the Devil,rap,Immortal Technique,2001,1169615,{},"[Part I: Dance with the Devil]

[Verse 1]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was makin' a million
Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of 13
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities on other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed
[Hook]
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

[Verse 2]
So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Startin' fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock
Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well-guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted
So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life
Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
[Hook]
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

[Verse 3]
They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone
Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head
And knocked her onto the floor
""This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw""
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screamin', ""Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!""
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lyin'
Bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
[Sample]
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow
He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black ‚Äî color is not restricted
You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever

[Intro: Immortal Technique]
Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?
Well, it‚Äôs not, you didn‚Äôt count on a fallen angel gettin' back
Into the grace of God and comin' after you
Y‚Äôall niggas ain‚Äôt shit, your producers ain‚Äôt shit
Your fuckin' A & R ain‚Äôt shit
I‚Äôll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker‚Äôs head off!

Go ‚Äòhead and grip Glocks
I‚Äôll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You‚Äôll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I‚Äôll watch you topple flat
Put away your rings and holla back
Can‚Äôt freestyle; you‚Äôre screwed off the top, like bottle caps
Beneath the surface
I‚Äôm overheatin' your receiving circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend‚Äôs dick
In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
Fist-fuckin‚Äô a pussy‚Äôs face, holdin' a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you‚Äôre less than nothin'
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me
I‚Äôll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I‚Äôm on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique‚Äôll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
You‚Äôre faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I‚Äôm 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I‚Äôm like time itself: I‚Äôm gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin‚Äô a chrome piece
I‚Äôm Illmatic, you won‚Äôt make it home, like Jerome‚Äôs niece
I‚Äôll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology
So you‚Äôre nothin', like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven
You‚Äôre like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you‚Äôre too basic, you‚Äôre never gonna make it

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent

What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""

Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer

Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number Two: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number Three: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number Four: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number Five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em, ""Bounce!""
Number Six: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back? Shit, forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number Eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number Ten: a strong word called 'consignment'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say, ""Hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks, she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

Wing$,rap,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,2011,1123974,{},"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like ""Momma
This air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly""
I hit that court, and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
""I touched the net! Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life""
Air Max's were next, that air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
At school, I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their Adidas
On the court, I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
Stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his Fours
Whoa

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
I was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right, wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins
[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this is that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me ""Be a consumer""
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
""Are you stupid? Don‚Äôt crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!""
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off
[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes",6142,en,en,en

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again

Now I'm comin' home again

How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play

Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, ""Baby, no way!""

Ambitionz Az a Ridah,rap,2Pac,1996,1078285,{},"[Intro]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And [?]) Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no,) 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah (Haha,) and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go,) give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama,) come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, ten-million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

[Chorus]
You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?
[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy, girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh), he said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer (Hehe)
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (ahh)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck ‚Äî blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus""? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson‚Äôs a] faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, ""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I‚Äôm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep

Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jes√∫s, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?

Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom

Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play

So I ran, I jumped out the back window
But her daddy, he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh (Haha), he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had (Haha)
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine (Woo)
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Come on)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
(Come on) So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe DeVille
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will (Uh)
[Verse 2]
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair, but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (Tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like a Kangaroo
See, I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said ""AIEE!""
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders' wife in the state of Kentucky
She said, ""I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me""
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs 'n' Spices

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Uh)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed (Uh)
And as the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech & Chong
(Ay, wait a minute man, check this out man, ayy ha)
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
[Verse 3]
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said, ""Yes, Miss Daisy""
Met this lady in Oklahoma, put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan, I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa, I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
(Haha) Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man, I thought I told ya?
Met this beautiful sexy hoe
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married, but I can't afford it
I know I'ma cry when she get deported

[Chorus]
Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need (Come on)
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed (Uh)

Extended version with a fourth and final verse:

[Verse 4]
Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good? (Say what?)
I mean, you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you, ""Where you from?""
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad 'cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on yo' ass, now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off
Said Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark, smoke that tumbleweed",2920,en,en,en

Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)

Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime

The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word‚Äî
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-

In place of the Doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face

So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass

While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead

I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist

Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick

They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup

Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I take sacks to the
Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‚ÄòCause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hitting, ‚Äòcause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‚ÄòCause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‚Äòcause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack
[Verse 3: Numskull]
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

[Verse 4: Yukmouth]
I been smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K
The Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‚Äòcause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back

Kill You,rap,Eminem,2000,982504,{},"[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til them vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playing
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down, bitch‚ÄîI ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut‚Äîokay, Ma?
""Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother
Abusin' a whore, snortin' coke
And we gave him the Rollin' Stone cover?""
You're goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ""acid rap,"" but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in
[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me

[Chorus]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you

[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathing
I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.‚Äã
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!
[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, ha-ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)

I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure

But all these girls never ever got her blowjob

Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thunderin', shakin' the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter

Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato

Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like niggas move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one

All them hoes, I got to like one

What you gonna do: fight or run?

How many flee when I cause the scene?

My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair

Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand

Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'

The takeover, the break's over, nigga
God MC, me, Jay-Hova
Hey, lil' soldier, you ain't ready for war
R-O-C too strong for y'all
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gon' win?
This is grown man B-I, get you rolled into triage, bitch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet, the navy
Niggas'll kidnap your baby, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your drama, uh
We kill you motherfuckin' ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to you, dunny, 'cause I overdo it
So you won't confuse it with just rap music

You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped ""Shook Ones,"" switched your demeanor
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people

'Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let 'em gas you like Jigga is ass and won't clap you
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
No, you're not on my level, get your brakes tweaked

You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started, but now, you're just garbage
Fell from top ten to not mentioned at all
To your bodyguard's ""Oochie Wally"" verse better than yours (Oochie wally wally, oochie wally wally)
Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin' song
But I know, the sun don't shine if son don't shine
That's why your (Lame), career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Nigga, you ain't live it, you witnessed it from your folks' pad (Yup)
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor (Me, that's who)
Then I heard your album 'bout your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong (I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me)
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song (Woo)
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was gettin' fucked then
I know who I paid, God, Serchlite Publishing
Use your (Brain)
You said you've been in this ten, I've been in it five, smarten up, Nas
Four albums in ten years, nigga? I could divide
That's one every, let's say two, two of them shits was doo
One was nah, the other was Illmatic
That's a one hot album every ten year average
And that's so (Lame)
Nigga, switch up your flow, your shit is garbage
What, you tryna kick knowledge? (Fuck outta here)
Y'all niggas gon' learn to respect the king
Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen

A wise man told me don't argue with fools
‚ÄòCause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga, I'm grown
Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
Please, not Jay, he's not for play
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yappin' be finished
You are not deep, you made your bed, now sleep
Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you
Nigga, I know you well, all the stolen jewels

Can't fuck with me, go play somewhere, I'm busy

The futures in my eyes, 'cause all I want is cash and thangs

I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless

Mediocres got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Mo√´t and pay checks

Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit

Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-Slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album

[Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

[Verse 1]
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son
[Verse 2]
My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple, but probably not, fuck em

[Verse 3]
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

[Verse 4]
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school
[Verse 5]
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep

[Verse 6]
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

[Verse 7: Tyler, The Creator, Dr. TC]
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

[Verse 8]
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I‚Äôm bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

[Verse 9]
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that

Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision

But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor

Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth

Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more

They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim

Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?

And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards

Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again

[Verse 2]
Can you picture what will be?
So limitless and free
Desperately in need
Of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land
[Verse 3]
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

[Verse 4]
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's Highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake, he's long, seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us
The blue bus is calling us
Driver, where you taking us?

[Verse 5]
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
""Father?"" ""Yes, son?"" ""I want to kill you""
""Mother? I want to...""

Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
Doin' a blue rug, on a blue bus, doin' a
Come on yeah
Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck yeah!
Come on baby, come on
Fuck me baby, fuck yeah
Woah
Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!
Fuck, yeah, come on baby
Fuck me baby, fuck fuck
Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Fuck yeah, do it, yeah
Come on!
Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Alright
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die

Aight, let's run it, let's run it
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker

'Cause they don't fucking--

I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast, motherfucker!

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more

Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with

So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""

No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""

[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]

And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

[JAY-Z: ""So what you think of this?""]

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Donda West: ""Come on, let's just go""]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""

[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""

[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""

So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no looking back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling, ""Too soon!
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
Ature on the subject; you sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry, hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Ayy, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part, play your part""

Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean

Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice Ice Baby""
Screaming, ""Shady 'til I die!""
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
‚ÄòCause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's ""back"" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‚ÄòCause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‚ÄòCause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this‚Äî
[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9""]
Uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says
""I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"" (C'mon)
Go back and forth and, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now, the semi‚Äôs the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity‚Äî

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (*ptt*), and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9"" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it
[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9""]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire, off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
That these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl? I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die

Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun

Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight

Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up

To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone

It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe

Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's fat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album cover he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the master is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's
[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city ‚Äî but Dre, you ain't from Compton

And ain't shit compared to real muthaphuckkin' G's

You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real muthaphuckkin' G's

How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""

You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
""Oh my God, I'm crackin' up"" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda‚Äî hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Good morning!

Good morning!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning and‚Äî
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning and look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

Here we are
Here we are
Yeah
This one right here is for the people

Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni k√™ra m√¥g√¥

[Interlude: Nas]
Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out the gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord
[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote

Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni k√™ra m√¥g√¥

[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience. That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World. A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?
[Chorus]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye

Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye

[Interlude: Nas]
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless, I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn

I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
[Verse 2]
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Canc√∫n
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam

And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right

I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

White America,rap,Eminem,2002,866376,{},"[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold‚Ä¶¬†or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) ‚Äî Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's‚Äî

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for‚Äî

So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House

To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks

I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said ""Damn, what's next?""
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate

Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size!""

Would you let me ride?""

A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

Guys, you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Uh-uh, come again (Yeah)
Hey, yo-yo, come again
My French men, come again
My sister, come again
[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Hook]
Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
'Cause girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls, you know you‚Äôd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Hey, we‚Äôve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you‚Äôre too young to really love somebody?

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too young to be in love, this is silly
You‚Äôre infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas‚Äù
I mean, it might be something I don‚Äôt know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What‚Äôs the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you‚Äôre in love with somebody you‚Äôre looking at it like this‚Äîyou‚Äôre taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You‚Äôre crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain‚Äôt never been loved before or been in love before, they don‚Äôt know what the feeling is to be loved)

The Inspectah Deck!
[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get ya flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh
[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left, aah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""suue""
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean O, yo check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

[Verse 4: U-God]
Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the ""suuuuue""

C'mon, baby baby, c'mon
(Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid)
Yo, you best protect ya neck
[Verse 5: Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

[Verse 6: Ghostface Killah]
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

[Verse 7: RZA]
Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearing Aeropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style
The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be
Comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius
Take us the fuck outta here

[Verse 8: GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‚Äòcause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me‚Äî

They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‚ÄòCause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‚ÄòCause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‚ÄòCause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine‚Äîwhat's my name?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sippin' on
He said, ""Lean, you wanna hit it, dawg?""
That's the same stuff Weezy's sippin', huh?
And tons of other rappers that be spittin' hard
Yup, he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink, heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sittin' in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin' as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healin'
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratchin', itchin'
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without gettin' nauseous
Room spinnin'
Thinkin' he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed, shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin' that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up
He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin' that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us
[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talkin' about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declinin' record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Little Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know 'cause he's my favorite
And I know 'cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit, pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feelin' like a failure
And trust me, it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parents' basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And ""weed's not a drug,"" that's denial
Groundhog Day, life, repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them, we used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheatin' and lyin'
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplyin'
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinkin' I would never do that, not that drug
Growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Lookin' in the mirror like I can't believe what I become
Swore I was gonna be someone
And growin' up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G
Can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
[Chorus: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
(I miss you, B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in heaven, smilin' down (Ha)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every day that passes
Is a day that I get closer
Every move I make, every single day
To seeing you again
We miss you B.I.G
Every night I pray, every step I take
And we won't stop
'Cause we can't stop
Every move I make, every single day

Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year‚Äîwho the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right‚ÄîI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year‚Äîwho the fuck are y'all?

What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right‚ÄîI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
Uh, one thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year‚Äîwho the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right‚ÄîI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right‚ÄîI'm doing me, I'm doing me

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red

Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at

Public Service Announcement,rap,JAY-Z,2003,819339,{},"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Jay-Z]
This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH‚Äînot D.O.C
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)
[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me‚Äîbut just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

Whats the Difference,rap,Dr. Dre,1999,811104,"{Eminem,Xzibit}","[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Intro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is, and who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they‚Äî (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level 'til Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid‚Äînever come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog‚Äîyou ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'

Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life

A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster

The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta

Just keep ya eye out, like ""Aye, aye, captain""
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it?
And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got ""Ooh, Lord""s
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Either that or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he bring his own needles

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

My man Inf left a TEC and a nine at my crib
Turned him self in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', ""It's so hard""
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter

From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater

And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka

You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

[Bridge 2: 50 Cent]
If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50‚Äîman, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

What? Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This like, this '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight, incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block
[Verse 2: Method Man]
As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back? In the line of fire, holding back
What? My peoples; if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot, and blow spots
You wanna think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover, kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God
[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

[Verse 4: U-God]
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell, globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

[Verse 5: RZA]
March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like flare
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular, my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation
[Verse 6: GZA]
War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, fuck that!
Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend
Bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, sazon season these degrees
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
A-yo, that's amazing
Gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat, God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala

You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it

They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back

Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!

But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

And you want a triple X throwdown

Let's call the boys, let's run a train
Squeeze on my nuts, lick on my butt
The natural curly hair, please, don't touch
First find a mate, second find a place
Third find a bag, to hide the ho face
Real name Rover, I said bend over
I started to knock, then came the odor
Smelled like mush, should've had a woosh
Told her to stop and take a douche
While she did that, I didn't want the cat
So I bounced out and never came back

My nigga D-Magic said he had to have it
I said, ""Just forget it, it's too crabby""
Know a little freak, in Hollywood
Sucks on dick, does it real good
She'll give you money, fill up your tummy
House full of kids, parents all schummy
Once had a down, backyard ground
Hit it from the back, enjoy the sound
Lay on the cover, always use the rubber
Till I got caught, fucking with her mother
She blamed it on me, we fought in the street
She pulled out a knife, so I had to flee
Called up the boys, went to her house
Charged the whole place, threw the bitch out
Police busted in, where the niggas at
We left just in time, and never came back
Roll through the hood, waving at the freaks
Who's sniffing all the rocks, and smoking all the geeks?
Made another stop, police station
Saw a few cops, drove by and sprayed them

And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread

How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P

From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small

Yo, they don‚Äôt know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
Some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently
Sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be
‚ÄòCause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it

You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go
[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds to the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method ""Name of the Game"" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped ""Megadef,"" took 'em to church
I like ""Bleach"", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme

Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:

Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock

Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the ""ass"" in ""assassin""
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
""What you doing?"" ‚Äì nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be

And since no good deed go unpunished

Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know

You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on

[Verse 1]
I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?
[Interlude: Tyler The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
""Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual""
""Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied""
""You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine""
""I try too hard, huh?""
""No, you don't""

[Verse 2]
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group (Yeah)
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make ""Parade"" or ""Inglorious""
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
""Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?""
""I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.""
""I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.""
""Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?""
""What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?""
""I have, I mean you're a great person.""
""I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?""
[Verse 3]
People excited, thinking shit is so tight (For what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...)
Fuck that, (Yeah) These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead (I love that shit) of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (They don't, it's not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]
""It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that ""faggot"" word, that's very, that's a bad...
""I'm not homophobic.""
""I mean, I don't think you are but...""
""Faggot.""
""Alright, well, since the last time we...""
""The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can.""
""I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD.""
""Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't.""
""I mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?""
""I wish Thebe was here.""
[Verse 4]
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear (I'd rather not)
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed (What?) his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
(I don't think anyone's going to men‚ÄîI don't think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you.)
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit (I mean, you...)
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
(I mean, you've explained to me that you were in school, but, I mean, I...)
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (No, you don't)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
(I believe you) All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
[Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

Drop the World,rap,Lil Wayne,2009,713258,{Eminem},"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‚ÄòCause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'‚Äî

You can try this at home
You can be just like me

I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)

Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)

Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal

But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist

Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco

I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found

Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong

Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 1: Melle Mel]
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 2: Melle Mel]
Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so, so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 3: Duke Bootee]
My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
[Chorus: Duke Bootee]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 4: Duke Bootee]
My son said, ""Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw""
[Chorus: Duke Bootee]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (Say what?)
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

[Verse 5: Melle Mel]
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool""
But then you wind up droppin' out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so

[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

About a lucky man who made the grade

Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

Dragged a comb across my head

Found my coat and grabbed my hat

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

You're paralyzed

96 ways I made out, Montana way

Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack

[Verse 1: Big L]
Yo, I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
Puttin' thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet, known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow? Hell no!
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough;
I'm known for yokin' Jacks
And beatin' them with smokin' gats
Leavin' token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear, son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
'Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightnin'
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes, I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug-related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks
Sellin' pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
I'm tellin' you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hottie stare
I keep a shotty near
It's that nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most, I'm leavin' niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smokin' dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed, and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids, I kept mad blades
Stabbin' teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak, 'cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper; fuck around
You'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a wild town
You know my style, clown, so bow down!
[Interlude: Big L + JAY-Z]
Word up (say what?)
'95 style (yeah)
I got my man JAY-Z here (JAY-Z!)
Check it out now‚Ä¶
Check it, check it, check it out now

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Brothers can beg and borrow, still feel sorrow
When Jay Z, like Zorro, get in that ass, better luck tomorrow
I'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down or get yo' ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky, to stop me you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone, you can still feel me, on the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven, I raise hell
'Til it's Heaven; recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me, nigga, it's bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin' Crystal, shootin' game like missiles
As projected, all hoes affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldie
But the goody, pullin' R&B bitches, wearin' hoodies
They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin'
When I be goin' I be runnin' the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things with a swing
And have 'em rockin' like‚Ä¶
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm, I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge
And follow with wisdom
For greater understandin', I'm landin' blows
And knockin' sense into those that oppose me
Enticin' when slicin' through tracks
You're screamin': ""Jesus Christ, he's back!""
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map, so give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that‚Äîfuck that!
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible, even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beatin' me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow; I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creepin' through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Bet your lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's tryin' to be the best
And even in dyin' couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin'
Ever since L said, ""Throw three G's in!""
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself, I get up‚Ä¶
[Interlude: JAY-Z + Big L]
Yeah, word life (Big L, try that mic out!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (back to Big L)
(Let's get it, back to Big L!)
Yo, one two, one two, aight?
I'll drop one more joint, aight, check it out
I ain't do this in a while, check it out
One two, one two, check it out
One two, check it

[Verse 3: Big L]
Ayo, my crew be deliverin' hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch; nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' them shits in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
I'm feelin' like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probly got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head, got loot 'cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'ma beat your faggot-ass half-dead
I stomp white cops 'til they life stops, for a low price, hops
'Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
'Cause my crew'll kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC-11 bucks
I'm killin' at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple, hun
Fuck love! All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown MC's I be attackin' quick
I'm on some rappin' shit and some car-jackin' shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac'
And put the gat to his cap, click-clack
Sorry, Jack, but get up out of that!
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin'; he started reachin'
So I left him sleepin' with his temple leakin'
[Interlude: Big L + JAY-Z]
Aight, back to my man JAY-Z
One time
Check it out, uh

[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it
I get it together like a marriage
I'm seekin' all rappers, I'm on my P's and Q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand, well
Goddamn, don't you know my status?
I'm flowin' the fattest
Mmm that is, mmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain, my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinkin' that's hollow
The rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
It hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath‚Ä¶¬†goddamn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, nah, whenever I'm in the
Uh, whatever I touch, whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya
Uh, the nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey
Hahahhhh, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in
Niggas are du-do-duckin', I'm bo-bo-buckin, fuck it
I'm wild, but a boo boo boo bam
What you niggas gonna do to the man?
I see you brought your little crew‚Ä¶ and?
I'm still comin' with velocity
Check it out, Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of these clowns fuckin' around
Ain't none of these clowns standin' their ground
With the crown prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
JAY-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be comin' out of their seats now
Shit, I got crazy skills, it's a pity the way I'm rippin'
Rugged rhythm through the city
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
I got rhythm, I hit 'em with rhythm, I
Hit 'em and split 'em, I did 'em, I get rid of them guys

Stadium status

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse 1]
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
[Chorus]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 2]
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""‚Äîgot to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, espa√±ol: ""No way, Jos√©""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!

Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòcause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‚Äòcause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn‚Äôt matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What‚Äôs it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain‚Äôt
Some bullshit; people don‚Äôt usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater‚Äôs ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‚Äòcause your hate is what gave me the strength

I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin‚Äô
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop

You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‚ÄòCause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer
[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)

Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a lil' class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel

Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

Diamonds From Sierra Leone Remix,rap,Kanye West,2005,665138,{JAY-Z},"[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me

[Chorus: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)
(Forever) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because
[Chorus: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)

People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (Uh)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (Uh)
You know the next question, dawg, ""Yo, where Dame at?"" (Uh)
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (Woo)
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Yup
I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time (Ha)

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""

Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay, I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say ""whore,"" Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it, now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got

I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That‚Äôs right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with the brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

Now that the party is jumpin'
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi
‚ÄúDid you stop?‚Äù No, I just drove by
Kept on, pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next stop
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to
A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, ‚ÄúDamn!‚Äù
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry

Come on Mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring ‚Äî quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone

Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried ‚Äî rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried

From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Outro]
Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'

Yeah, I'm happy

Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no
[Chorus 1]
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
(Fuck, I was scared)
Everyone's leanin' on me
‚ÄòCause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‚Äòcause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

Everyone's leanin' on me
‚ÄòCause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‚ÄòCause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of
My soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs
Bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And‚Äî
[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well‚ÄîI tried

See you had a lot of moments that didn‚Äôt last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn‚Äôt your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don‚Äôt be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn‚Äôt never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn‚Äôt last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
[Bridge]
See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You‚Äôre beautiful, you‚Äôre beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You‚Äôre far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn‚Äôt never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn‚Äôt last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn‚Äôt never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
You had a lot of moments that didn‚Äôt last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together

Love the Way You Lie Pt. II,pop,Rihanna,2010,621101,{Eminem},"[Verse 1: Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",1805,en,en,en
One More Chance,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1994,620934,{},"[Intro]
All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that, mommy?
*Beep*
Hi, daddy, how you doing? This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mm
You actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all of that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?
*Beep*
That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit
You fucked her every time you see her
You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you
""Why the fuck B.I.G. don't want me?""
*Beep*
Yo, B.I.G., this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that
*Beep*
Yeah, motherfucker, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me
You be disappearing and shit, I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call, alright?
[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¬°Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back
[Chorus: Total & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position
I got you wishing for an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lickin' you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nuttin' all of a sudden

Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I‚Äôm a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There‚Äôs never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I‚Äôm a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I‚Äôm so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don‚Äôt care where ya are
Just blink twice and I‚Äôm there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain‚Äôt been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It‚Äôs gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I‚Äôma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I‚Äôm going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don‚Äôt wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J‚Äôs put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I‚Äôm in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I‚Äôm being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I‚Äôm at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he‚Äôs slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I‚Äôm un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I‚Äôm a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture

Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do

They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'

C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can

Everyday Struggle,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1994,612619,{},"[Chorus]
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 1]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 2]
I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle
[Chorus]
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 3]
I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Mo√´t, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker

It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back

Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone

Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own

Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‚Äòcause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road
[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‚ÄòCause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
AllƒÅhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars‚ÄîI know it

Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?

Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch

I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

Class out the ass, bad with the swag like Buffy
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet
I'm a sinner, but I bet I could've been a better man
I wanna be Zen, but I go sippin' on some medicine
Instead of meditating, but I get it when I can
I don't wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt
Liquor, bitter 'cause I never got a call
Telling me that it's all figured out
I'm sick of doubt, but I'm looking at the wall
Part of me was hoping to be caught up in the moment
And be open to the good and the God in me
But I got a lobotomy
And I get that I oughta become a bit of an oddity
When somebody gets offended by the thought of me
""Who's he?"" ‚Ä¶You gotta be kidding me!
Do me like Gabourey Sidibe
If you see me with a chickadee
No diggity, it'll be giggity giggity giggity
Gonna send it like a letter from above
With a woman that I love, 'cause I get it like I live
But if my baby's gay, I'll say: ""You go, gay baby
Work that crib! Work that bib! Burp that kid!
Screw police! Flip that car!""
I don't want a Jesus piece
But I want a Reese's Piece and a Kit Kat Bar
I want everybody focusing on getting me to Letterman
To kick it for the betterment
Of innocent Americans who never want to settle
For their pop‚Ä¶ or not, 'cause my bedroom rocks
And the beat still knocks when I sort my socks
I'm five-foot-eleven of sex
From the tip of my head to my gorgeous... knees

Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling

Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my

Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town

Telling me about a party up in NYC

She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through

Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to

The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread

When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space

In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take, wee

Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won‚Äôt remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have

I'm taking my life back)

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I laughed while you wept

Did me a favor though, my spirit free you've set

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half till I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still?
Man, I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you ‚Äì go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to
Shit, I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch
And it's just‚Äî

Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need four more hoes, we need oh, oh, oh, oh!
You know what it is when we out of town
We balling too serious, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fucking with the best in the world

You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps

Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I Anita-bake her; now, she caught up in that ""Rapture""
I got so much chips, I swear, they call me ""Hewlett Packard""
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mother-fudge cake; now, tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake‚Äîsoo-woo!
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it‚Äîremix!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
‚ÄãiPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that ""I think I'm late"" text

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'

We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it‚Äôs killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn‚Äôt you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce

Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

You should have a travel agent, ‚Äòcause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever

But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on

I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish

If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)

The farewell email from a female
But I‚Äôm a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she‚Äôs not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can‚Äôt ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It‚Äôs hard to throw up them deuces
‚ÄòCause when you know it‚Äôs juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)

Made me special here on purpose

About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur

Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse

Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

Only God can judge me now

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‚Äòcause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‚Äòcause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix

I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets

How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‚ÄòCause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt

There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace

Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross

On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit

You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say ""when you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe, but ayy

For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'

I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to, huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet‚Äîinvasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‚ÄòCause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Mo√´t with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell
[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator, Earl Sweatshirt]
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me ""Tyler toughen up""
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating H√§agen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it, moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers, that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang banging in your system
Probably banging in your sister
With my children swimming in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo

Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're‚Äî""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (Uh)
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)

So I'm guessing there's questions that need addressing, huh?
Like how we fresh in our adolescence and wrecking 'em
Hand 'em tracks, he destined to make a mess of 'em
Snapping necks and records in matter of seconds, check 'em son
Lost an erection and found it in an aggressive nun
Fucking chin-checking punks 'til he's outta breath and done
No FX, in these doper than sess sessions son
Chilling for a while on a pile of the rest of 'em
Let the crowd choose who can fucking last longer
It's the rap monger, rap monster, Earl Sweat, attack, conquer
Lose least, niggas lost like the last blanca chica
That we picked up at the last concert
Please, get out your seat, get out your seat, verses written with scalpels
He's the junior king standing out shouting on the balcony
How come he's not in counseling? Fucker's loud while he's sound asleep
Heard he was dope as Sour D, nigga, was Courage cowardly?
Stay gold, alchemy, nigga we rap's alpha team

And a nose full of chowder, he's chopping up all the doubters see

Fuck with the Wolves, we starting to bark viciously
Catch us in a pile of bodies where dead bitches be
Box Logo hoodies and goodies from buddies that understand
That Bastard was buzzing like Woody so we get it for free
Had to duct tape the mother goose; the mask was off
I stumbled down a hill then I had Jill jack me off
Harder than my dick when Taylor Swift is in my basement
Cause I've been doing this since Pooh fucked Christopher Robinson
Wolf Gang knitted on my cotton like some smelly
Dirty rotten nigga picked it from a cotton gin
Do not give a fuck I've got the swagger of a virgin's dick
But if I did it would be bigger than Earl's upper lip
Sip sizzurp, Supreme on my shizzirt
I munch a bunch of tacos with Waverly's favorite wizard
The favorite nigga turned into Freddy Kruger
And this that raw shit, dead bodies chopped up in the sewer
From the palms of Jeffrey Dahmer, baby mamas said the kicks
Beat like the brown lip balm that was made for Rihanna
All you fucking bloggin' faggots yappin' up that extra shit
I'll shove Bastard down your throat, regurgitate my excrement
Them 2DopeBoyz is fairies they're Peter like boysenberries
Meka scary, turn his white ass to a Jim Carrey twin
A fuckin' sausage fest will them shaky niggas get married then

But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please? Do it faster, baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast... but I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan Man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit' me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit' me, Chi ride

And I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could (Me too)
Buy me a spaceship and fly (Swear I do)
Past the sky, oh

Buy me a spaceship and fly

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check‚Äîwasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole‚Äînever got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly

And I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Tryna tell you, man, way past the sky
Oh, oh (Let's go, ugh)

[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently; I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift
Aww, man, this pressure
And I ain't made shit

Buy me a spaceship and fly

I've been working this grave-shift

I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly

I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, bow!

[Verse 1: Nas]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged‚Äîplus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!
[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together ‚Äî what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‚Äòcause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3: Nas]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‚ÄòCause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)

Man, you must be up out your mind

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man

I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls

It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing

Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me

Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?

Goodbye to the India Arie Award

Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker
[Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police
[Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him‚Ä¶ Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by

I would never wish death on nobody

Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally

Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days

Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won't budge

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur‚Äîwhat's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

I still believe in man

I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude

Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, ""Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard""
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please

So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, ""Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen""
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks

But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please""

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place

They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too

‚ÄòCause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)

They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‚ÄòCause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed
[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‚ÄòCause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch, doing the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing 'cause shit that she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz
[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz & Snoop Dogg]
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

[Verse 3: Kurupt & Snoop Dogg]
To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the streets to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? (Why?) 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now
[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
Uh, I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop, we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
I'm heartbroke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit
[Verse 5: Jewell & Snoop Dogg]
Ooh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I'll let her know that she can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thing (Bitches ain't shit)
Down with the swang (Sing to these hoes)
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal (Bitches ain't shit, Death Row)
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back
Hell yeah, they need to chill (Tell these motherfuckers)
Because I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit), and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck (Tell these motherfuckers)
And now I gotta do some‚Äî
I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But when I'm on the dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washer machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho (Bitches ain't shit)
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't tryna say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with their nuts hung

Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‚Äòcause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely
[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 2]
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 3]
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I'll take my chances
Before they pass

I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""

Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""

And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale

The dope boy I just came off the spoon

Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

Hahaha, that's right

Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me d√©j√† vu

And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie

Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control

Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‚ÄòCause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‚ÄòCause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‚ÄòCause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‚ÄòCause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these

Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‚ÄòCause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back
[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & Eminem]
Look at Em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo‚Äî) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?

God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name

That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‚Äòcause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot‚Äîfuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
[Chorus: Mobb Deep]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
(Y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

[Break: Big Boi]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on‚Äîlike Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping‚Äîit's a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack-man
Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (Real)
You can go on and chill out and still build
Let your paper stack 'stead of going into overkill

Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from ""home of the brave,"" with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts‚Äî
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge‚Äîmeet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad‚Äî
Need some hope like the words ""maybe,"" ""if,"" or ""probably""
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift‚ÄîI'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?

I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-Black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
G‚ÄîGet back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
You 'ear that? You can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (Quit)
Because ""Aquemini"" is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, Andr√© Ben', welcome to the lion's den

I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it‚Äîthat's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when

You are about to experience something so cold, man

Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man‚Äîman, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home

'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake

When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here

Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga

My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight

I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""

Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me",633,en,en,en

Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again

And I think that I just realized what it means

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

Everythin' the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better report
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first

‚ÄúWhat the human race is suffering from is mass hypnosis. We are being hypnotized by people like this: newsreaders, politicians, teachers, lecturers.‚Äù

When no one's talkin' about how they made us modern-day slaves

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now, let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Verse 5: Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that
[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

[Verse 7: Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man LG

The character is of men, never ever of mice

You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
[Chorus 1]
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off

'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah

Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say

[Verse 3]
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep

This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked ‚Äì that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time

Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly

Ahh

Oh my God, oh my God

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
""I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse""
""What's the matter?""
""I don't know, my leg, it hurts""
""Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy""

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die, honky""
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug"" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look, bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry, son""
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late
He's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!

[Hook 1: Kanye West and Cam'ron]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

I ride on chrome, gone

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla troop
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue, you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof!
Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he's gone)
Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now
[Hook 3: Cam'ron]
We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking ""Cons, how long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone
[Break: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""",684,en,en,en
Family Business,rap,Kanye West,2004,496647,{},"[Intro]
How's your son?
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
He made the team this year?
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here, we gon' cook this Sunday, OK? So come by [?]
That's your new girlfriend?

[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo you heard the track I did man, ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
[Chorus]
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all, tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Now all I know I know all these things

[Verse 2]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, ""See! That's my cousin on TV!""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be Electric Slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photobook up
I got a Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin
Fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
[Bridge]
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi is my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
Second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

[Chorus]
(All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing (All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold (All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
And all I know I know all these things

If I Ruled the World Imagine That,rap,Nas,1996,496240,"{""Lauryn Hill""}","[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‚ÄòCause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world

If I ruled, I'd free all my sons

What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you, bitch?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh, no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo and craps
Packin' gats in a Coach bag, steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now, who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical

[Break: Method Man (Inspectah Deck)]
On the chessbox
""Wu-Tang style""

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags
My rap style has the force to leave ya lost like the Tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the Killa
Rap fanatic, representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now, lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode!

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast in hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot! Top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave

[Verse 5: RZA]
You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like Fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck!
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

[Verse 6: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior, killer? Slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar!
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin' make me wanna kick they fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique, drop that science!

[Verse 7: GZA]
My-My-My-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Poaw! Now it's all over
Niggas seein' pink hearts, yellow moons
Orange stars and green clovers",2705,en,en,en

She wants to erase me, hmm

And this what she tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

Uh, I'm Yeezy, she say ""Hi, I'm Aria""
No, you a angel, you wave ""Hi"" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, you something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, ""No, not my Aria""
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

My Darling,rap,Eminem,2009,491236,{},"[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‚ÄòCause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‚Äòcause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: ""Come nearer!""
[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‚ÄòCause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling

Take the bass line out

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' ‚Äì feel me?

Instead of kisses, we get kicked

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Verse 1]
Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""
[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‚ÄòCause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

[Chorus]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass

You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help

[Verse 3]
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace

Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)

Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‚Äòcause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But, Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two; you're practically a ten
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin

Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""

Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya

With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak

Thank you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me ""Rap about life, not rap niggas""
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to ""Faith,"" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won‚Äôt break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, ""The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?""
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I‚Äôm trippin'
But little did they know, I‚Äôm tryna' change the rules
That we‚Äôve been confined to, so the corporate won‚Äôt make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don‚Äôt know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain‚Äôt doing this for my health, I‚Äôm tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough)

Apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin', and
I'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
Even my girls can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dyin'? I am finally realizin' I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks, I've been havin' ups and downs
Goin' through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
Of endin' this shit right here, I'm hatin' my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors

You killed it!"" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men

Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up

Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?

[Bridge: JaVont√©]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love",49693,en,en,en

I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it

Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...

Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo

Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""

Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""

Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?

I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Every step that I take is another mistake to you

Become so tired, so much more aware

American love
American me
American you
American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, ""I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"" (Oh)
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked

Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, ""Woo!""

How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit

This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now

So Many Tears,rap,2Pac,1995,469757,{},"[Intro]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
[Refrain]
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come
[Refrain]
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

[Verse 4]
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

Lord, lost so many years
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

And shed so many tears

Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it

I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep though, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through

A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up

Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
""Let's do this,"" it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS ‚Äî you see me stressed, right?

Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on titties sayin' ""B.I.G."", now check it:
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino hoe, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fuckin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Came out on bail, commence the ass-kickin'
Kick in the door, wavin' the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial
Fuck around and made her milk box material
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips
'Cause of you, I'm on some real ""fuck-a-bitch"" shit, uhh
[Chorus: Lil' Kim (Biggie, Lil' Kim)]
Fuck bitches, get money (What? Ain't seen none of these girls)
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money (Uh)
Fuck bitches, get money (Whoo, look at me)
Fuck niggas, get money (Whoo, I told you niggas)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Niggas, better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch 6 feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard bound, niggas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin' than the stick-up juxs
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave?
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards sayin' ""I apologize""
Is you with me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me
Nah, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know
[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can‚Äôt help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn‚Äôt me
But now I‚Äôm searchin‚Äô for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don‚Äôt be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin‚Äô
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won‚Äôt do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don‚Äôt give up
What you won‚Äôt do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don‚Äôt give up

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don‚Äôt wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I‚Äôm back
To makin promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I‚Äôm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin‚Äô to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I‚Äôm 'bout to lose my composure, I‚Äôm gettin‚Äô close
To packin‚Äô up and leavin‚Äô notes, and gettin‚Äô ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I‚Äôm feelin' low, losin‚Äô control
My heart is sayin‚Äô leave, oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin‚Äô calls at the house, guess you cheatin‚Äô
That‚Äôs all I need to hear, 'cause I‚Äôm leavin‚Äô, I‚Äôm out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you‚Äôve been cheatin', I‚Äôm a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won‚Äôt do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don‚Äôt give up
What you won‚Äôt do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don‚Äôt give up
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings‚Äôll go away
It wasn‚Äôt always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin‚Äô tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don‚Äôt worry 'bout it, we can do it now I‚Äôm under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I‚Äôm waitin‚Äô, when I‚Äôm alone
I‚Äôm on the phone havin‚Äô secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I‚Äôm a sucka for love

You tried everything, but you don‚Äôt give up

I am Iron Man

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or, if he moves, will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
[Verse 2]
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

But gravity always wins

The rest is empty with no brain, but the clever nerd
The best MC with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the TEC-9 holder
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitters ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not an act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back; clack-clack, blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart-toppa
Start-shit stoppa, be a smart shoppa
Shot-a-Cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (Is it?)
Hot enough black (For ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, boast yo' skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he gets older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes
Where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro
O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act, all black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sings soprano, like, ""Una, duociano""
My momma told me
Blast 'em and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum
No stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream, we could skip the weddin'

I see you looking at me
(Psst, hahaha, over here)
Looking at me, so I ask

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I‚Äôm a psycho
I guess I‚Äôm a psycho

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You‚Äôre crazy! I like you, but you‚Äôre crazy
My tours paid me, so I used that dough to allure ladies
To manure bathe me
Never that, my mind's for sure shady
Pure Hades, Rev X said that he couldn‚Äôt endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?
When I felt that burn, I palm the clitoris, I'ma get her wet
Sorry to get carried away
I feel stupid 'cause I ain‚Äôt did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
I get vexed so N9ne bit her neck
Open! I try to contain it, but that dame thang‚Äôs soakin'
Alter ego say: ""Why you let them gangbang folk in?""
Strange Lane hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain‚Äôt nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I‚Äôm sufferin', I‚Äôm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', I'm a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scaldin' water on my balls

Mom? Dad? I‚Äôm no longer the boy you're used to seein'
I‚Äôve changed a lot, plus I‚Äôve grown to hate every human bein'
My mood swings have now turned
My dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I‚Äôm doin' things I don‚Äôt normally do when illusion seem
To be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would've put down the mic
And said, ""Fuck it, I'll never rise to fame.""
But with the wicked wreckage I contain
I could probably jeopardize your name
No lovey-dovey, let‚Äôs ignite the flame
If you‚Äôre lucky you'll survive the pain
Sorry, that ain't very merry to say
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well, let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are gettin' too hairy to shave
Pause a minute, I'm stressin' again
If I go to Hell, then Heaven's to blame
I don‚Äôt mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think I‚Äôm hella deranged
When I was seven years old
I fell on my head and I severed my brain
You think I‚Äôm lyin'? Then ask my mama
Nigga, she'll go tell you the same‚Äî
Should I be ashamed? No
I‚Äôm livin' my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent out of shape

Yeah, I‚Äôm a psycho
I guess I‚Äôm a psycho

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I stab you with this mic, and rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter of fact, I‚Äôm rappin' through you
Never say my motherfuckin' name
Unless you absolutely have to
I am not no fuckin' jacket with no matchin' shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Can‚Äôt even see you niggas, y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact, act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion to use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes; it's just like old-fashion voodoo
Y'all ain‚Äôt even the shit, no, y'all ain‚Äôt even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots
So I‚Äôm slappin' you foolish with wooden paddles, you stupid
Babysittin' little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic, but it‚Äôs more like schizophrenic
And I can't sleep, can anyone tell me
Just where my medicine is?
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man, I swear I'm all about my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I were to peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma feel it crack when I hit it
Then I'ma split it back when you heal it
Damn it, Bobby boy! What in the hell?
What in the heaven? What in the Earth?
Where is your mom? What are you, cursed?
Where are you from? Where was your birth?
Where was you first? Why weren‚Äôt you in church?
Why is there dirt all on your shirt?
Man, I think that you‚Äôre goin' berserk

Making your wacky wishes come true...

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag, y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, sca-bobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by thoughts of me and her together, right?

And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at

And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?

With a hood rat you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro

One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive!""
'Cause it's hard to survive

And these girls keep Passin' Me By
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway

But don‚Äôt get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (Nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (Bitch), but she know I‚Äôm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Peso, euro, yen, ah-ha, I‚Äôm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit

Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn‚Äôt give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I‚Äôm givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I‚Äôm sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So, I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it, double timin' it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say ""K-Mart's"" like there's an apostrophe ""s"" on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn‚Äôt a restaurant, well I guess I‚Äôm wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg!

And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I‚Äôm as strong as they king, they were gone ‚Äòfore they came
Now I don‚Äôt wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you‚Äîwhat you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble

These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a‚Äî

They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a‚Äî

These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

Even if my collarbones crush or crumble

A-yo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some; short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there

Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go

Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates (Contact!)
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip
With a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out!
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex, next!
It's the textbook, old to the new, but the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo; what's the scenario?

[Verse 3: Dinco D & All]
(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an (L-ah-!), an (-eader!), simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her

Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh

Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)

Stay away from crime, so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did‚Äî
‚ÄîI heard you rushed and rushed (and attacked!)
Then they rebuked and you (had to smack!)
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear‚Äî

So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego

Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary, when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Unh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario

Yeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her

I'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something
I got a little bank, y'know, no problem
I hear you, that's cool (Alright? It's cool)

Of course my friend. What happened to your hand?
Oh, food at last!

Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food
What other food?

I do, DOOM
They disappoint me, they must work faster
But the prisoner-
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him. I have special plans for that one

[Verse 1]
Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it

And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)
[Verse 2]
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, ""Aw Hell!""
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, ""Hell no, sell y'all own Jello""
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (""Food!"")
[Verse 3]
What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?

Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater

To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

But it's the evil that made me

And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em

I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?

'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
(Let me get serious for y'all, one second)
[Verse 3]
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer
Asking him ""why?"" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again",759,en,en,en

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Mo√´t drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‚ÄòCause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere

Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)

While you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action

You're on a plane now, eatin' they food and their baked beans

And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em
They tested with stress that they under
And nowadays, things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me, it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‚ÄòCause any day, they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‚Äòcause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined

Livin' out of bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery
Even now, I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered‚Äîthe beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking it light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell

Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is
[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)

My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I‚Äôm like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

Liquid Swords,rap,GZA,1995,449044,{},"[Skit: Gibran Evans]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of 131 lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed

Fake niggas get flipped in mic fights
I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene
Like a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
But it was your op. to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in Da Front want it

Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two-to-four
'Round the clock, that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be stickin' with, you can't state the crime

I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells

[Chorus: Nas]
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Rock on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues (What the fuck?)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the uptown hot block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said ""pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, haha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88, what?

Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Geyeah, know what?
I'll make, you and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, advance
You're coppin' me like white crystal
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life, man, pounds and pence
'Nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
Catch me swingin' for the fence
Dead presidents, ya know? Uh-huh

Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Haha, yeah (Haha) yeah, so be it
The Soviet, the Unified steady flow
You already know: you light, I'm heavy, roll heavy dough
Mic-macheted your flow
Your paper falls slow like confetti, mine's a steady grow, perico
Pay 580 for blow, better believe I have 1160 to show
My dough flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the icon, baby, you like Dom?
Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners
Heavy spinners like hit records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected, this shit is perfected
From chips to chicks to strippin' a Lexus
Naked without your gun, we takin' everything you brung
We cakin', you niggas is fakin', we gettin' it done
Crime family, well-connected, Jay-Z
And you, fake thugs is unplugged like MTV
I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure
Dead presidentials, politics as usual‚ÄîBLAOW!

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me, then he told the people ""You can call me Your Majesty""
Keep your battery charged, you know it won't stick yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (""Your mother‚Äî""), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name
[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles

Ready for war, Joe, how you wanna blow they spot?
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles
We'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor
Joey Crack, buck 'em all if they move‚Äî
Noodles, shoot that fuckin' whore!
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
Little did we know that we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
It'll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real, I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake
Smack you, then I whack you with my snub three-eight
[Verse 3: Big Pun]
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family's children
Like Amityville, and drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's buildin' a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealin'
A villain without remorse who's willin' to out your boss forever
And take all the cheddar like child support

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother, sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me; one of the best‚Äîmight be even better
Leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee

Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what?
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck
Truck jewels (Jewels), cruisin' in the Land, bumpin' ""Cash Rules""

Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make 'em eat dirt
Take 'em feet-first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the First Amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights
Tonight, I hold my rosaries tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina, m√°s fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me ""Don Cartagena""
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police
Though you should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat
And I'll leave you right there, so beware
It's rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun, speak, and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

[Verse 7: Big Pun]
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin'
Catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three TECs is in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-of-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down
[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine every time
Plus, I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it, go and get it; set it, baby, and I'ma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin'
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas 'til it's armageddon

You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you the new kid on the block

And have you lookin' foolish like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that, 'cause
You follow Future like he got carrots up his ass crack
And when you actin' up, that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid, like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
""It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!""
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

Uh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry 'bout getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit ""re-dial"", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
'Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit

I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe 'cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
'Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over",516,en,en,en

Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away

Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break

Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life
[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

I'll slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
Why you muggin' me like somethin' was wrong?
Just take a puff of the bong
And let me leave your mind corrupt from the song
See, you can't stop me, 'cause I'ma brainwash teens
And create false dreams, 'cause it paysÔªø off clean
I'm just an idiotic, ironic, symbolic, Illuminatic product
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it (Shhh!)
This industry bidness is all screwed up
I have no favorite rapper, because all you suck
I sever the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
'Cause on a tombstone is as hard as their name will ever be
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot
I do! Be offended by every sentence I jot
I got some militant thoughts
And you ain't killin' 'em off, so listen!

Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve

You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried

Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky

Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, ""What you talking 'bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White

Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga, stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen

Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something

I don't do black music, I don't do white music (No)
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face ‚Äî what now?

How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around

I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, ""Go!"" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist

When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang (Oh!)
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of an angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames (Oh!)
Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains (Woo!)
I ain't believe it then; nigga, I was homeless (Uh huh)
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners
Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona
'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him:
""You either build or destroy, where you come from?""
""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""
""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"" (Ooh!)

I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot (Oh!)
Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb
At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, ""What's up?"" (Buh!)
Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up

Out in London, smoking, vibing while I ride the tram
Giving out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And‚Äîby the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops

Just a Friend,rap,Biz Markie,1989,430956,{},"[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...",2694,en,en,en
Nocturnal Rainbows,rap,Hopsin,2010,429811,{},"[Intro]
You think you're original? You ain't original
You were programmed to be you
You're a slave, and you don't even know it
The shit you think of, ain't even your thoughts
Let's step out the box for a minute!

[Verse 1]
How do we know if God exists? How do we know it's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealin' it
But if the tables turned, then you would pocket it
See, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothin' like an angry crook
I'm learnin' hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world, so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become somethin' so unique where I'm from
[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power, then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

[Verse 2]
Obama's president, so? What's he represent?
Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charmin' smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus, and all you fools believe it
The change he's makin' isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we're all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealin' with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour, then have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack ones get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes; there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created
[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

[Verse 3]
Yo, we're all smart, and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet, when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fuckin' powerhouse, but what, that wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that ""shoulda, coulda, woulda"" stuff
You probably threw your life away ‚Äòcause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Sayin', ""I should've did this"" or ""I shouldn't have hung with this guy.""
""I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized.""
I ain't bein' cruel with these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest
Keep bullshittin' till your life is gone
‚ÄòCause livin's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on
[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

[Chorus]
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‚ÄòCause I'm a ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

(Right‚Ä¶) It's halftime
(Right‚Ä¶) Ayo, it's halftime
(Right‚Ä¶) It's halftime
(Right‚Ä¶) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‚ÄòCause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‚Äòcause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‚Äòcause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‚ÄòCause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
[Chorus]
(Right‚Ä¶) It's halftime
(Right‚Ä¶) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right‚Ä¶) It's halftime
(Right‚Ä¶) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‚ÄòCause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matin√©e
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‚ÄòCause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap

No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace

Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Aliz√©, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis: Is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

(You don't know what you're doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî)
Sure, I do

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'd follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless
[Interlude]
I am Hov (You don't know what you're doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî)
Sure I do

[Verse 2]
I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin' to get they ones, I'm tryin' to get them M's
One million, two million, three million, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now lookin' at the forty million boy
I'm rapin' Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man

[Interlude]
R-O-C (You don't know what you're doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî)
That's where you're wrong

[Verse 3]
I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
Could make forty off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin' at one smart Black boy
Mama ain't raise no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth, motherfucker
[Interlude]
I will not lose (You don't know what you're doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî doin'‚Äî)
Put somethin' on it

[Verse 4]
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
Get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown

Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?

You screamin', ""Go 2Pac!"" and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made

Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules

Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Aliz√© and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark

You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On WBALLZ
Right now, something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now, I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple mo' times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one, trick-ass bitch!

Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em

Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees and then start jugglin'

Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high (Now, now, now, now)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year, I was going through hella problems
'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I was a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?""
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music and fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

Now who the hell is this
Emailing me at 11:26
Telling me that she thirty-six, twenty-six plus double-d?
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now, she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late, mami
Your screen saver say Tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
You mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib (I mean)
That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib (I mean)
You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high (Yeah), ow

I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well, okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
Her sister the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a OkayPlayer-hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet (No)
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate

Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then

N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high (Yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high (Mm-mm, uh-uh, uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high (Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)

And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot

[Verse 3]
Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

(Music stops
Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!"")

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom P√©rignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

You can be the peanut butter to my jelly

You can be as cold as the winter weather

I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human

But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human

I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
""After I fuck you in the butt, get some head

DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration is eight
He's intubated and we're bagging him now
Uh, BP 90 over palp
Patient is cool, pale, and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, uh, GSC is 3
Will update en route, ETA: ten minutes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene
To receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium
Like, ""yeah, that's great""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
""Mommy, something is wrong with Dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 Musketeers in the rear seat""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like d√©j√† vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear, I've been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fucking hear
""Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
""And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time""
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half a glass of wine
Sounds asinine, yeah, I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm 'bout to fall
I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by
[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like d√©j√† vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ahhh!)
Couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn
[Chorus: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like d√©j√† vu

Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, ""Damn, that man's face is just like my face""
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths
[Verse 2]
Music business hate me ‚Äòcause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell ""holla""
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' ‚Äì I ain't been rhyming like Common since (Whoo)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths
[Verse 3]
My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
‚ÄòCause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, ‚Äòcause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)
[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
""Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!""
Uh‚Ä¶ Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‚Äòcause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me

I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me

It's like a kiss was laced

Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously, yuh

You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back‚Äî back then‚Äî then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and Au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog‚Äî
Fuck all that flirting‚Äînow, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""

You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

Lord forgive me

Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your momma
""Momma, he's dead,"" the next morning
I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping on enemies
I'm headhuntin', no sympathy
Ain't no love when you in these streets
Just get something, protect your neck
'Cause they coming for sets, respect
Split your onion, then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street‚Äîindubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game‚ÄîI'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high

And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands left
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a key
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M

Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't niggas""
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics

Nightmare,rap,"Tyler, The Creator",2011,410129,"{""Tyler / The Creator""}","[Intro: Dr. TC]
So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
Well, first off...

[Verse 1]
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems
[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me‚Äî
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker
I'll see you in a couple, OF

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems
[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?

[Verse 3]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink‚Äî (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, ""O.F. is the best""
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)
Cause I don't know how to...(whoa)
All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
""Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat""
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back
[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 4]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm going in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga, get off me

[Outro]
(Calm down, man)
Fuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time
[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (""Here, Momma, try 'em on"")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again
[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake
[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do

Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for you

Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor ‚Äî father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV

My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

Down to ride to the bloody end

I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‚Äòcause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend

[Chorus: 2Pac]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

I'm back where I belong (Uh, yeah)

I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song

Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean (Come on)
What if my twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom? (Why?)
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs (Let's go)
Another day, another dawn (Come on)

You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again‚Äînot again!

It's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em
I said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin' all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em

[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor

Passin Me By,rap,The Pharcyde,1992,406249,{},"[Produced by J-Swift]

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o' clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

[Verse 2: SlimKid 3]
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man
[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her
And it went, ""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you
Very well now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn

So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back

And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET ‚Äì and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‚Äòcause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""BOOM BOOM!"" and yo' guns go ""pow pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on
[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
Come on, put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it on, represent, put it on, Come on!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
(You don't know?) you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella, put it on and on!

I drink Mo√´t, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adi√≥s, ghost, I'm gone

Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beach, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5 or Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin' PJs
Now we reached the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride? It won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm thick, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters

I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
Now lay your head on my chest and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks cum

Up in the hot tub poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love, got you screamin', ""Punish me!""

Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants

And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls

Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none

Uhh, Big Pimpin' in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't never take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin' to find my next thrill
Feelin' myself, I don't even need a X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin' in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin' on the steps
Drinkin' quarter waters, I gotta be the best
M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next
Hold up

Freeze, somebody bring me back some money please
I got a million ways to get it, choose one
Bring it back, now double your money and make it stack

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes

I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Dreaming‚Ä¶ of falling
Dreaming‚Ä¶ of falling

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Tryin' to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-Town)
Hopin' for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Sellin' out arenas with big-ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened (Never)
Like I never had dreams of bein' a rapper (Rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes (Classes)
Like I never used to run away into the blackness (Yeah)
Now, let's pretend like it was all good (Good)
Like I didn't live starin' in the notebook (Notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (Should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood)
Yeah, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name (No)
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin' back before the mixtapes (Cloud 9)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame (Yeah)
Before they ever once compared me to Andr√© (Three stacks)
Before I ever got on MySpace (Yeah)
Before they ever noticed my face (Yeah)
So let's just pretend and make wishes outta airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
""Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win.""
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
""Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!""
""You won't amount to shit‚Äîquit daydreamin', kid!""
""You need to get your cranium checked.""
""You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic.""
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‚ÄòCause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that‚Äî

Come on
Ugh
Come on

[Verse 1]
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double ""I'm Mad"", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot
[Interlude 1]
Yeah
Yeah, back in this

[Verse 2]
With poetry my mind I flex
""Flip"" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the ""Stutter Step"" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Bridge]
What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot

Black Nationalism
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them

With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (Whoops!)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down! (Oh)

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke?
No? Okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke

Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady

I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine

We can't get jobs, 'cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for

With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

Yeah

[Verse 1]
So you wanna be hardcore?
With your hat to the back
Talkin' about the gats in ya raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screamin'
Maybe I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams
Still some MC's gotta feel one, caps I gotta peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggas sayin', ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill ya quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks-es
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby
[Chorus]
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

[Verse 2]
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From stayin' in my business, what is this?
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfuckin' meet again, huh
I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the Ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the (blue suits)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin' dick
The funk, baby
[Chorus]
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"" (Uh)
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

[Verse 3]
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin' helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
""What's love got to do...""
When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons
Niggas wanna know how I live the mack life
Makin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes
It's type, simple and plain, to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

Maybe that is why I chase strangers away

Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood

Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'

Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in

I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays

Made Hov say, ""Okay, so? Make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again? Even if I don't hit again?
Dog, are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch
With Donatella Versace, that's Louis Vuitton, bitch
I think Hennessy, I drink, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years, Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And hey, please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo, I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, rock a chain 'steada wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance, cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show, a couple dykes in the van
It's easy, the hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy, I did it for the glory

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What I'm supposed to do now? Man, the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah, that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego, I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my momma Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard, man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill, two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking 'bout her girlfriends, yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking 'bout the speed boats, yeah, I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person, what do you feel like?
I know, I know, I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know, B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live, I wanna be compared to B.I.G
Any one: Big Pun, Big L or Notorious
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Yeah, I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit, uh
These haters be killing themselves, they wanna come and get the glory

You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block
(Partner, let me upgrade you)
Ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Beyonc√©]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep 'em on a leash, though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sendin' me a drink ain't appeasin', believe me (Believe me)
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?
[Pre-Chorus: Beyonc√©]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And I'ma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still played my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

I be's the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars, this is high-level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (He-he-he....)

[Bridge: Beyonc√©]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes a diamond really shine
And you already is a star but, unless you flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly

Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The ""land of the free""?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun

9AM in Dallas,rap,Drake,2010,391740,{},"[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

Uh, yeah, this what yall want

Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? Y'all niggas all fed up 'cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems,"" gotta move carefully
'Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me, oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryna do me
If the record's two mil', I'm just tryna move three
Get a couple chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll m√©nage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car

What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more?
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground, I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four-pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live?
I told you '96 that I came to take this shit and I did
Handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Niggas, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Holla at me)
Ain't no love (Take 'em to church), in the heart of the city
Uh, uh, uh, uh, my nigga, where is the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Fuck)
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Then Richard Pryor go and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful, you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Haha, and more baggies, why you all aggy?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit

Yeah, ahem
Hey, yeah

Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff, like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them holsters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school-made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store, she wasn‚Äôt buying that shit
No, I ain't crying a bit, man that's just life, that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with Cupid
He beat you and you went back, you's officially stupid
Oh yeah, I understand, that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now, your daughter'll probably get her ass whooped

Time to save the world
Where in the world is all the time?

But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce
It‚Äôs Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and motherfuckers that hated school
Said, ""That's for busters,"" then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I‚Äôm gifted as if I‚Äôm Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate, so you know a nigga late
To my first class, I‚Äôd much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah, I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes, I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
'Til I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks, can you play? Pardon me
What's your name? Don‚Äôt mistake me for no lame, no, not me
She knew I was on the team 'cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin‚Äô niggas, eventually, R.I.P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it happens
And if a nigga step up to you, then you gotta scrap 'em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
It's funny, I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see, some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At fourteen, I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don‚Äôt know your dreams, then they can't shoot 'em down

No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and, oh, so cold, it's, oh, so cold
Oh, so cold, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

Where do they go? God only knows

Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park, and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda, and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl, you mighta
Heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I'd a‚Äì
-ssault and rape, then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
""Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?""
""He's rapin' me,"" she tries to scream, ""Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny""
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratchin' like some dumb freak
Escapin' me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat

Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'ma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, biddy-bye-bye, biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazin' skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back

Childrens Story,rap,Slick Rick,1989,389524,{},"[Produced by Slick Rick]

(Now here's a little something that needs to be heard)

[Intro]
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
All right, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah
Here we go

[Verse]
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
""Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him (Sorry)
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (Who?)
Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing eighty-three
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head, he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""Back off or honey here is dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on (Uh-huh)
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh (Uh-huh)
Just another case about the wrong path (Uh-huh)
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast
Good night
[Outro]
(Knock him out the box, Rick
Knock him out, Rick)
- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird
- I know right what does he mean
‚ÄúStraight and narrow or yo‚Äô soul gets cast""?
- I don‚Äôt know, I think he be crackin' it up or something
- Well, good night

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive, hence, if
I should draw the line or any fences, if so, to what extents, if
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chris-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five-cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super‚Äî
Man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain

I forgot my name

[Verse 2: Eminem, Dr. Dre]
Now in the Bible, it says:
""Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
'Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly-known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?""
Let's ask Dr. Dre‚ÄîDr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question, if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But‚Äî 'ut, I ain't done yet
In football, the quarterback yells out, ""Hut-hut""
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
It was never meant‚Äîit was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in‚Äî
His teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

You find me offensive, I find you offensive‚Äî
Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and
Open up a whoop-ass canister
God damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good-at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic‚Äîyup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom, I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit

Check my swag

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go, baby
A'ight, a'ight, look
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets, lookin' for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one 'til it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the emcee
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood?
I shouldn't, yes, I should
Ridin' through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like, ""Hello,"" to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

Yeah
Well, I must must say (Yeah?)
Well, um, I'm just not gay
Well, um, I must must say
Um, well, look- (Mr. Porter, son)

See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart 'til I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy, class clown as high
To a grown-ass man stackin' motherfuckin' paper
Runyon Ave.'s the clique, D12's the game
We've been spittin' this shit since we was little b√©b√©s
Gaga goo goo, nana, nani do do, never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot'll leave a nigga's face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyeded, 
When I bust it off in the crowd, niggas start divin'
Greg Louganis went over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot iron lethals, not defyin' a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than niggas that understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle, we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been had to hustle

In a pair of acid-washed, bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin' Gratiot 'til I damn near crashed the car
I'm tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off (Woo!)
Over the bridge, into oncoming traffic, caused
A massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all (Woo!)
Hopped up holdin' an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spittin' flames, kickin' fire out your ass, you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid, dawg
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playin' basketball while I'm goin' through crack withdrawal (Woo!)

I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic crossed
The path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports (Look)

Woo!
God, look, look-

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
I shoot straight off the hip, trey-eight off the rip
But see, I ain't fo' that shit
I got a fist print fo' yo' lip
Lookin' shit is swole up like the stomach on a fat pregnant bitch
And it's evident that I get chips like the president
Been a lotta rules, keep the tools for the haters left
Niggas ain't fadin' 'em, seal a crack, do a trim
Got a lot of dough, but you know I ain't trickin' on 'em
Get some head spinnin' on 'em, keep the head spinnin' on 'em
See, I ain't diggin' on 'em, keep the head hidden from 'em
You know how it go, no dough trickin' on 'em
She just wanna blow, see what she can get from 'em
But she don't know my name, I'm 'bout the game, I'm pickin' on her
Wrist so cold that my left hand's numb as summer
I rip a hole 'til she don't want you gettin' on her
She makes you wonder if the women even want ya
Mr. Porter, keep a ho in order
Learned it from my daddy, I teach it to my daughter (Yeah)
Ya ought to know the quota of my whole workout
I float like Noah and I don't want the boat to rover bounce

Ahaha, yeah

Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished huffin' the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacin' stares, he glares, makin' the hairs
All on the back of yo' neck stand like Dracula, yep

Throwin' animal parts at Scarlett Johansson

Scrap back, you niggas weak as Chuck Nevitt
I fuck buckin' naked; Jesus piece swing reckless
Entrepo-po head honcho, hope you're ready 'fore
I pop his ass, nigga, kickin' through your door
You send goons to do your work
I send goons to mamas in church, I've been a problem since birth
Got a middle finger up her skirt
I don't ask a bitch on a date, I ask her can I fuck her first
See y'all with this Runyon shit
I made somethin' out of nothin', I'm a hustler, bitch
I keep a 9 tucked, burnin' up the side of my hip
Gotta make a hit for any nigga for fifty-thousand chips

Bitch!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 7: Eminem]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel, posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting, doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only s'posed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standin' over the sink, posing
Myself, self-loathing, 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think, ""This will make everything rosy""
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toe-sies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodeling
""Rosey, won't you come out to play?"" Ain‚Äôt no sense
Wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Neurofens in my syrup and stir them
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events, and then he emerged, took
Over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the buildin' and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels, and
Still can spin straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol‚Äî three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothin' but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit' it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, emcees'll get fricasseed on the grill then

[Verse 8: Eminem]
Everybody get up, sit up, Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
-live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this-a
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hidin' in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and I jump from my skin gushin'
Nails into my face that I've been pushin'
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic, I can squish a
Sucker like a vise grip, my pen put ya
In the slaughterhouse, 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off, like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter, both]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit (Huh-uh)
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice (Yeah)
I got you slippin' on my swag juice (Okay, look)

[Verse 9: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now, nigga, see
My-My mind's right, money right, can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight, I never should'a left where I was livin'
I pro'bly wouldn't be gettin' pressed by all these women
But then again, I wouldn't have met the ones that I was diggin'
Sanaa Lathan lookin', talk a lot
Don't she like Lil Kim and Kim and, uh, Serena Williams?
Just like my [?] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch, called me talkin' 'bout she pregnant
She praised me, so I Mannie Fresh'd that ho and left baby
I'll never trust her, no
Shit, even if she specialize in mouth, massagin' my testicles
I never trust her a whole lot
Even on the first day we met, she's basically gettin' her mouth raped
Then turned around and ask me for a kiss, ""No, bitch, I'm straight""
I never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

[Pre-Chorus: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice
I think I'm 'bout to slip on your swag juice
Oh no! No, no, don't slip on your swag juice!
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter, both]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, alright, ayy

[Verse 10: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there, sister
Bound to get you dizzy, 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee- baby, you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard
Standin' in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it?
Now, baby, don't forget to bring your lipstick wit' ya
I want the kiss 'fore I blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
-ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turntables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second, tell me what the heck is sicker?
Wait a minute, I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now, baby, just to make a little breakfast and it's six o'-
-clock in the mornin', 'less you want to get some dessert

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter, both]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice
I said, here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag, my swag juice

[Outro: Eminem, Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood, Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Yeah!
Hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
Ayo
Just so everybody knows, that was a hook
That we made on the way to the radio station
And we were tryin' to get it right
So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever, but
This is what we were tryin' to, like, work out before we came here
Especially for Westwood, man! 'Specially for you, homie!

This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Word, time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape ‚Äî no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black
[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic ‚Äî as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Se√±or Escobar
[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Mo√´t Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it, times three, we got 48, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or

Corner-sittin' wine niggas sippin' Apple Boone

The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck

I judge wisely as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin' between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave 'em split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Dominant Islamic, Asiatic, black Hebrew
The year 2002, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads gettin' slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow

I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps

I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C

But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, ""Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me""
My girl found it in the car and said
""Baby, why you trying to diss me?""
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

You said, ""One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode""
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

""Life,"" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
And disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off
At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not bein' a millionaire
[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore
After work, in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', ""Where hip-hop lives""
[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough
Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks
If I had one wish, I would ask
For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm sayin'?
Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?

Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be

Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me

You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies

We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony

You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth

And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak

Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can

All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man

Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need

You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell

You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?

Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)

In the store, in the store, in the store
In the store, yeah, yeah yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
(It's this girl)
She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
(It's this girl)
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images‚Äîher face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook
(This girl)
Video chats are so exciting
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (Arrrrgh!)
(It's this girl)
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah, my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch
(It's this girl)
Her name is my password
Fuck
[Verse 2]
(This girl)
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts
And she's special
I know, to y'all, I come off as rough; but I'm the nicest to her
And I just want to concur, a relation
I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands, walking home
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate, but
(This girl)
Things are looking great; cut, copy
Last time we talked, she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
(Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's, she's not alone (Fuck)
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her? (Shit)
Come to find out, she got back with her nigga...

[Interlude]
(Damn!)
Fuck

Another one
It's not the first time

(It's this girl)
She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself?
Sit in my room for some days?
Play Xbox with piles full of wet socks? Fuck that
(Girl)

[Verse 4]
My nigga ask, ""Ace, what happened to such-and-such?""
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked (""Yeah, I fucked!"")
Or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie, and say she moved to Nebraska

She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas

I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night

And all I had to do was put two and two together

We handpainted strawberries on a swing

I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing

Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn

I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

Of a dying world
And millions are left behind

[Intro: 2Pac]
I love L.A
No Doubt
To live and die in L.A. (California)
No matter what you say about Los Angeles
It's still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold part about it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen'
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the sin
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail

My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe so many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen' right across from hell
I can't cry, ‚Äòcause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‚ÄòCause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in 'em
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in L.A

To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angels sing

Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love yo' hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mufucka permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A
[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it

Okay, how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?

[Teacher]
I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

[Boy]
Willingness to do everything for that person

[Teacher]
Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk, c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

[Boy 2]
The way they act

[Teacher]
Uh-huh

[Boy 2]
The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

[Teacher]
Okay

[Girl]
The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

[Girl 2]
Yeah

[Girl]
It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

[Teacher]
That's deep

[Boy 2]
That's what I'm talking about

[Teacher]
I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

[Girl 2]
It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

Say Whats Real,rap,Drake,2008,375108,{},"[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‚ÄòCause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister

[Verse 2]
Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

[Verse 3]
I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop

Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came, they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Mama can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Mama say ""You makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? It ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby
[Outro]

Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)

I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Rock.. on, Roc-A-Fella y'all

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine till the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches
Watch how I'm walkin', 'cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil, thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Freeze off my kneecap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinkin' Cristals, re-up the fee
Rappers goin' broke tryin' to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
You know this nigga: JAY-Z, Shawn Carter
G.S. the fuck up, dree-ess the fuck up
Watch me shine like a Breitling, Breguets the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's
Small timers, I said it, I'm addressin' all drama
Talk to me!
[Chorus: Nas]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
So sick of niggas
""I want money like Cosby"" ‚Äì who wouldn't?
This the kinda talk that make me think you probably ain't got no puddin'
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail
You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L, but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin' in your 7, next day, you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitchin', ain't you? Ready to start snitchin', ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak-ass: hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped in the station, filled up on octane, and now they not sane
And not playin', that goes without sayin'
Slayin' day in and day out, when money play in, then they play you out
Tryin' to escape my own mind, lurkin' the enemy
Representin' infinity with presidencies, you know?

Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)

Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)

Thank Me Now,rap,Drake,2010,372215,{},"[Chorus]
You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Yeah
Well, alright
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of ""influential,"" I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, 'cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
[Chorus]
Y-You could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now (You, you, you)

[Verse 2]
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me, I'll miss it
'Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at ""Hello""
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it‚Äì
I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
[Chorus]
Y-you could thank me now (Thank me now), go 'head (Go 'head)
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said (What I said)
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
It's a- okay (Okay)",518,en,en,en

'Pac
Hey
What's happening
Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
Fo' sho', hey
Observe
And you ain't going back?
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
This is for the honeys, the superstar
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well let 'em know

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..
[Verse 2: Richie Rich]
Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

[Chorus: 2Pac]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something
Come get a taste of Amerikaz Most Wanted
And let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

[Verse 5: Richie Rich]
You can ride out with sport coat, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and sport coat can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

[Chorus: 2Pac]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?

[Verse 7: Richie Rich & 2Pac]
It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga

[Chorus: 2Pac]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day

One Mic,rap,Nas,2001,371595,{},"[Produced by Chucky Thompson and Nas]

[Intro]
One time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now
[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (That's all I need)
All I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (To spread my voice to the whole world, baby)",490,en,en,en

I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me cabron, plus maricon
Said she likes to cook rice, so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this Black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap
She like, ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
Ma cherie amour, tu es belle
Merci, you're fine as fuck, but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather?
She said, ""All you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me, you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian, and Black

I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
Goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the mile high club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first-class seat, I love

'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""
I got this ho that after twelve million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe, I love

Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce-zeroes
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes

Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed

This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun

If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)

The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,misc,T.S. Eliot,1915,366970,{},"S‚Äôio credesse che mia risposta fosse
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
Ma perciocch√® giammai di questo fondo
Non torn√≤ vivo alcun, s‚Äôi‚Äôodo il vero,
Senza tema d‚Äôinfamia ti rispondo.

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ‚Ä¶
Oh, do not ask, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, ‚ÄúDo I dare?‚Äù and, ‚ÄúDo I dare?‚Äù
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair‚Äî
(They will say: ‚ÄúHow his hair is growing thin!‚Äù)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin‚Äî
(They will say: ‚ÄúBut how his arms and legs are thin!‚Äù)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
For I have known them all already, known them all:‚Äî
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all‚Äî
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all‚Äî
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare,
[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
And should I then presume?
And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?‚Ä¶
I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ‚Ä¶ tired ‚Ä¶ or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me,
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet‚Äîand here‚Äôs no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
To say: ‚ÄúI am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all‚Äù‚Äî
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
Should say: ‚ÄúThat is not what I meant at all,
That is not it, at all.‚Äù

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor‚Äî
And this, and so much more?‚Äî
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
‚ÄúThat is not it at all,
That is not what I meant, at all.‚Äù

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous‚Äî
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ‚Ä¶ I grow old ‚Ä¶
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.

We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.",1499,en,en,en

Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast...
But I know somebody who can, Twista!

Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of ""Roll It Slow""
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me

Express Yourself,rap,N.W.A,1988,366308,{},"[Intro: Dr. Dre & Ice Cube]
Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
So what you want me to do? (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel
[Chorus]
Express yourself (Ah, ah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah)
Express yourself (Smoke, smoke)
Come on and do it (Yeah, kick it over here)
Express yourself (Do it, do it, [?])
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...
[Chorus]
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, [?])
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Yeah, yeah, do it)
Express yourself (Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre in full effect and N.W.A)
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just
[Outro]
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, this record's almost over, almost over, gotta get hyped up)
Express yourself (Do it, do it)
Come on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)
Express yourself (Compton's full of fakes, Compton's full of fakes, yeah)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (That's what she said, what she said)

No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‚ÄòCause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & (2Pac)]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (Thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky",4239,en,en,en

But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
""He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you""
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said ""Hello""
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said ""Hell no""
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?

Every one of His Majesty‚Äôs swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord

You broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know

Talkin 2 Myself,rap,Eminem,2010,358823,{Kobe},"[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins, on the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God, it
Feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
""Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself
You're slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
Is declinin' with your self-esteem, you're cryin' out for help""

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded
You pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one
[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um‚Ä¶

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)

Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown-nosing nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like an old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire, testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican

So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men

What, y'all niggas get front-page articles?
Y'all mention JAY-Z name?
(This thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z
""In JAY-Z news"" (Check)
I understand what y'all tryna do
I brought the flutes this time though (Check)
Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru
Give me some more music in the headphone
Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
Let's do this thing (Let's do it right this time)
Come on

H-O-V-A
I got my mojo back, baby, ""Oh, behave""
Nah, nah, don't be afraid
Y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all, from afar, threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And now, you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry, Ms. Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little na√Øve in them articles that I read

[Verse 2]
Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line (It's real)
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist
But they don't call me the dude to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (Yap, yap, yap)
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write (The fuck is you sayin'?)
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that, though (Haha)
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen, God, you a flea
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me
Nigga, hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me
They feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest 'til you on one knee

And watch how we roll up, and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major

Better than a chick that say ""Yes"" too soon
Until you have a daughter; that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?
Get they first car and then, IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line

If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?""

First line‚Äîshould it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
""What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still""
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt

Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!
[Hook: Johnny P & (2Pac)]
Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
(What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!
[Hook: Johnny P]
Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends!"" ‚Äì we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga
[Bridge: Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
I swear somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive

Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands

Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen

So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on R√©my
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""

It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'

""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it

That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
[Hook 2]
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
[Interlude]
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!

[Verse 3]
Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviours
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth
[Hook 3]
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth",980,en,en,en

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building, on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo; flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick, and could my clique do the score?
She said she loved my show in Paris at √âlys√©e Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter"", when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? Think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot

And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme

You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk

Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‚Äòcause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal

Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wan' check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‚Äòcause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it

No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things

Because this type of shit, it happens every day

I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon a cup
I said, ""Um, mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?""
There was a rumble jumble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard!""
But that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil Of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the files for my fingernails
Due to the night and on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean, dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my Kangol
And then I dilly (dally), I ran though a (alley)
I bumped into my old girl (Sally) from the (valley)
This is a girl plays hard to get so I said
""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset, she said
""It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me""
Now what was I to do
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, um, ""Don't cry, dry your eye
Here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother stepped up, said to me ""hi""
Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong, I said ""What is going on?""
I tried to break it up, I said ""Stop it, leave her""
She said ""If I can't have you, she can't either""
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but
She gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick
She said, ""Why don't you give me a play
So we can go cruising in my OJ?
And if you give me that OK
I'll give you all my love today
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Oh, MC Rick, my love is here to stay!""
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, ""Cheer up,"" I gave her a kiss
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you miss.""
She says, ""No, you're not!"" then she starts crying
I says, ""I'm nineteen,"" she said, ""Stop lying!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover!""

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn‚Äîshout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don‚Äôt sleep
Figure it‚Äôs my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can‚Äôt fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He‚Äôs leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

Hot shit (Hot shit)

[Chorus]
Mmmmm, I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

[Verse 1]
Mmmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertainin'
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit!)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I‚Äôm Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Wild niggas, loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd, nigga

Ask me again and it's going down, nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown, nigga
Pound niggas, what you be giving when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talking that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I

From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana

Dickie shorts, Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out, here come the folk‚Äî""Damn""
Oh, Lord

[Verse 2: Andr√© 3000]
As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set It Off"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
""Hey, hey‚Äîlook, baby, they playin' our song!""
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting‚Äî""Wham! Wham!""
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, ""Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""
It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute

Into You Remix,rap,Fabolous,2003,337673,{Tamia},"[Intro: Tamia]
I think you're truly something special (Ooooh)
Just what my dreams are really made of (Dreams are really made of)
Let's stay together you and me boy (Ooo-ooo-ooh)
There's no one like you 'round, oh baby
Oh, I wanna love you, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, oh, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the '90s into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you

Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary and VS dipped Jesuses
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah

You're a dream come true (You're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (Ever leave my side, oh no)

[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)

(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)

[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can‚Äôt get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You‚Äôre fucking wet, fish

And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause

Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room

This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she‚Äôs a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn‚Äôt feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‚ÄòCause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same

Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)

Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Skit: Pain In Da Ass]
Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked

Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

[Chorus 1: Mary J. Blige & Jay-Z]
I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

[Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige & Jay-Z]
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

""Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?""
""Is this not why you are here?""

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Turn the music up, turn me down
Guru, let's go get 'em again
This time it's for the money, my nigga
Brooklyn, stand up

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong
With so many different flows, this one's for this song
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, ""TAA!""
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up
[Chorus: Hum-V]
What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I gave this up to you
I know this much is true, true, true
My love

[Break: Jay-Z]
What more can I say to you? You heard it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down south
Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought
Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name
Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol, I make payroll
Benz paid for, friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit
Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go
By without me bein' fly, fresh to death
Head to toe till the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say? Guru, play the beat
[Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)]
My nigga, hahahaha, woo!
We gon' let this ride into the hook
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
- Get my grown man on
Let's go!
(What more can I say?)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly, it's both
I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact, I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it
One-two and I won't stop abusin' it
To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it
Back to the music, the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TT in the forehead
Tell her, ""Please forgive me,"" then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no, I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist

Who Will Survive In America,rap,Kanye West,2010,331164,{},"[Verse: Gil Scott-Heron]
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon, better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want

How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip

I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit

With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said",3666,en,en,en

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead

He fucked up, yo..

Time, time for you to die

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low though""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out .44s and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz
Thinkin' 'bout all the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin' something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Ma$e shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

Hell, we don‚Äôt give a fuck
We just absolutely don‚Äôt give a fuck

Uhh.. I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at

What part the game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin' lovely, with yo' spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryna break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue Six Coup√©
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out
The block for distances, givin' long kisses, bitch
[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Only I can do now, I say a prayer for you
You know, that‚Äôs the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind
Because, see your mind is in control of your heart
Where it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart has got to control your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cruel, you have made me cold

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. yo'.. ass.. goodnight

Frank White the menacin', Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new Hummer in the summer when
I was a newcomer then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke, girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke your ass out 'til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it), this brolic alcoholic
Like his weed greened out, like his brick solid
Distribute to kids who take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine all the time
Slugs hit your chest, tap your spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked four times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no

Man, duke, I was in love with this girl,, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[Verse 1]
Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 ‚Äî my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? ""Oh, I'm fine"", my name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh ‚Äî yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

I played it low though
I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go

Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right""
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, ""Can I have a dance?"" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 ‚Äî weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., ""Come now"", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months ‚Äî she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months ‚Äî I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months ‚Äî flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic

Big wad of money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo, you want a five-oh? The dope man's got plenty
To be a dope man, boy, you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a key to a g it's all about money
10 piece for 10 base, pipe comes free
And people out there are not hip to the fact
If you see somebody getting money for crack, he's the

Well, suck this bitch!

Wait a minute -- who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit -- this bitch is trying to gank me
I'll slap you up side your head with nine inches of limp dick!

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
You need a nigga with money so you get a dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She likes his car and he gets with her
Got a black eye cause the dopeman hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Find that he's slapping you all the time
But that's okay, cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but a dopeman's bitch!
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut
Popping that trash might get you fucked up
You'll sit and cry if the dope man strikes you
He don't give a fuck - he got two just like you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
Sh'es called the strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho
Do anything for a hit or two
Give tha bitch a rock, she'll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick
Strawberry just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around or she'll give you gonorrhea
And people out there are not hip to the fact
That Strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack to the

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
If you smoke 'caine, you're a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock
Jonesing for a hit and you're looking for more
Done stole a Alpine of out Eazy's 6-4
You need your ass whooped cause it's out of this earth
Can't get a 10 piece need a dolla fifty's worth
Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone
You're robbing and stealing, bugging and illing
While the dope man's dealing
What is killing your pain, cocaine, this shit's insane
Yo, E, she's a berry, let's run a train
[Eazy-E]
Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch

[Ice Cube]
Me neither; Ho, go home and wash out your beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo, what the fuck yo gotta say for yourself?

[Eazy-E]
Well, I'm the dopeman - yeah, boy, wear corduroy
Money up to here but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket's getting bigger

[Dr. Dre]
Yo, got that five-0 - double up, nigga

Yeah, high rolling, big money I'm folding

Ho, you want a hit you gotta get your knees dirty
Well, that's my life that how it's cut

Hey, dopeman!

[Spoken: Eminem]
Yeah, can't stop now
This might be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming ""Attack!"" like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces

I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh!""
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous",537,en,en,en

If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‚Äòcause I'm straight with the Roc

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

Matter fact I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks

Flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists

Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers, now you ain't laughin', huh?

While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter

I grab the saw and sawed her arm off and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome, spittin' box of trees, got you niggas
Shakin' like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out
Sharpen it, stab him, put a arch on it
Pour unleaded gas on him, get the Zippo and spark the shit

Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light

Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

(I'd appreciate your input)

[Verse 1]
Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means ""Small Craft Advisory""
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time,"" you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch ""X-Files""

Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me! I'm promotin' you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (Nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away

I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An eighty-three-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me? (Ugh!)
Please don't‚Äîyou'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history (Aah!)
But then again, you'd finally get your wish
‚ÄòCause you'd be all over the street, like 50 Cent (Hahahaha)
You fuckin' punk! Pussy, fuck you, chump!
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tryna jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you‚Äîwe hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases and probation‚Äîfight me!
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists, right in
Front of the only thing that you have in this world- a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you're the only white boy up in that bitch, just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white (Haha)
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down!
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head‚Äîgo ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‚ÄòCause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap (Haha)
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch, ain't it?
Raymond? Here, let me break this shit down in layman's terms for you
Just to make sure that you can understand us
And Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, and let me slow it down for you
So that you can understand if I say it slower

[Verse 1: The Game & (Sample)]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")

So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I‚Äîlove you""

[Verse 2: The Game]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like M√Ωa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")

The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

This life shit, this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out, son, for real
See, to live is to suffer
But to survive
Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering

[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Verse 1]
I've been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma
Be that seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinkin' about how short I was
Goin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
When I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin' high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast
[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Verse 2]
That ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks
Catchin' vics, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick
Used to get high, just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'
Three years later showin' signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Verse 3]
Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin' shit, like, ""Damn, look how that rock got him!""
Open like a window, no more indo
Look at a video, sayin' to myself: ""That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV,"" believe me, it could be done
Somethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due
[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
All up in my ears
Better now than never, business before pleasure
The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight (YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin', make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up
Our music keeps you movin', what are you provin'?
Turn that shit all the way up, yeah
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Music's gettin' louder
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
This shit is hot!
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nuthin' but choked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'ma win 'cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uhh) you rakin' up plaques
[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did, quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect, squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
Supreme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider, then they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Gus was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man, I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but, son, I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion
[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 3]
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top

Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy

I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
That I'm dwarfin' all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, ""C'mon, son!""
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, ""She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some""
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?
[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
She's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not ‚Äî aww!
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable ‚Äî naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it
[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction when)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl? Come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premiere
Seducin' her, loosen up
With a little freestyle that'll‚Äî wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you losin' her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow-out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
You think you killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick... aw, fuck
[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut

But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down

All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through

Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley (Uh-huh)
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely (Ugh)
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a jux
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now, he feel he undefeated, he mean it
""Nothing to lose"" tattooed around his gun wounds
""Everything to gain"" embedded in his brain

Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds, and here come two...
Opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian

As soon as she hit the door, we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast (Ugh)
She crying, headshots put her to rest
Pop open them briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot: sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol-gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement (Uh-huh)

Miscommunication lead to complication

Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son

Now, now, how come your talk turn cold?
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man wanna act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come

Now don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
'Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have ‚Äòtil it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
'Cause you might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?

Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone...
Cowboy
[Interlude: MF DOOM]
[Applause]
No, no, no, no enough

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
Goony goo-goo, loony cuckoo
Like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue, but who knew
The mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a tracklist in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumbtacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in it for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain‚Äîhis smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics‚Äîhe smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him ""spike the punch""
Curses, he's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy
[Interlude]
[Applause]

[Outro]
Sometimes they were comedic‚Äî or relentlessly horrifying
They were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent
Frequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day
Collectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come
The villains

We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, ‚Äòcause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, ‚Äòcause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
""Regime"" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday ‚Äì how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, ""Reenact him, you go platinum!""
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy

And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip

Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust
[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac

Never say I‚Äôm better than Hov, but I‚Äôm the closest one
Heard you lookin‚Äô for trouble, what, I‚Äôm 'sposed to run?
Your bitch invited me inside her, ain‚Äôt I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that‚Äôll blow your tee off, put a hole in one

Talking hard, but y‚Äôall still ain‚Äôt push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain‚Äôt pussy
Hmm, fuck it, everybody can get it
When you‚Äôre this hot, everybody‚Äôs a critic
But when you‚Äôre this high, everybody‚Äôs a midget
All this mean-mugging from niggas that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half-past-rich
With my badass bitch
And you don‚Äôt want no problems, on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ‚Äôbout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming ‚Äôbout?
Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout",1811,en,en,en
Sorry Blame It On Me,rap,Akon,2007,309169,{},"[Intro]
As life goes on
I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do
Is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home, just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
[Chorus]
I understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
[Chorus]
I understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
[Outro]
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me",2234,en,en,en

Yellow Brick Road,rap,Eminem,2004,308640,{},"[Intro: Morris Casuto, Spiro Agnew, Randy Blazak & Eminem]
What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (Yeah) their throwaway children
We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross (*Burp*)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each‚Äîand each generation should do a little bit better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks
[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge: Eminem]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like, ""White boys don't know how to rhyme.""
I spit out a line and rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place""
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‚Äòcause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
""Exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!""
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
""You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!""
All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‚ÄòCause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the ""Ole Foolish Pride"" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‚ÄòCause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a‚Äî
[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Bad Meets Evil,rap,Eminem,1999,308138,"{""Royce da 5\\'9\\\""""}","[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9""

[Verse 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth
[Chorus: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt
[Interlude: Eminem]
Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what‚Äôs up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" & Eminem]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)
[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon

Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea
You ready?

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Can you feel that? Yeah

And guess what? In thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars

It's like this, man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night

When the Music Stops,rap,Eminem,2002,307041,{D12},"[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality: sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres (Bah)
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, ""Damn!"" when you slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call?
When the music stops
[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
Your head just explode with red stuff
I'm handcuffed, tossed in the paddy-wagon
Braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war wit' your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night (When the music stops)

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark like, ""Woof!""
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said ""Fuck tha Police,"" now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock

So I‚Äôm single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don‚Äôt hold on too long 'cause that‚Äôs how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can‚Äôt escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I‚Äôm learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save

It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I‚Äôma need a thug wife

Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I‚Äôm talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same

Thats That,rap,MF DOOM,2009,306430,{},"[Verse]
Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share a strawberry morning
Gone, an more important spawning, torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions
Auditioning morticians, saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhymin' emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meager fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bee's knees for sheez, G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop degrees to stop diseases, gee-whiz, Pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a rolling stone
Star like Obama, pull a card like oh, drama
Civil liberties
These little titties' abilities riddle me, middle C (Ahhhh!)
Mmm, give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z, what you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot bod, heartthrob
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet, Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him

Growing Apart To Get Closer,rap,Kendrick Lamar,2010,305843,"{""Jhen√© Aiko""}","[Produced by Tae Beast]

Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
Where are we going, we should be slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
That‚Äôs what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We don‚Äôt even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I‚Äôm in these streets with everybody, I‚Äôm trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don‚Äôt reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
That‚Äôs what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I‚Äôm off track
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions

Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball

Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah

Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now

That‚Äôs what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don‚Äôt know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I‚Äôm following evil
Guess I‚Äôm following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don‚Äôt need you

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It‚Äôs just a part of life and if your vision‚Äôs impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision‚Äôs so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we‚Äôre always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we‚Äôre getting closer

Starin Through My Rear View,rap,2Pac,1997,303235,{Outlawz},"[Intro: 2Pac]
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Multiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops
Snitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me, then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
[Hook: 2Pac]
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya: talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

Now I know the answers to the question
‚ÄúDo dreams come true?‚Äù
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I said, now I know the answer
‚ÄúDo dreams come true?‚Äù
Starin' at the world through my rearview

They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
Nigga, Kadafi say!

[Verse 3: Kadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview

Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world‚Ä¶The world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do: just gotta put our mind to it and do it, it's all about the papers, money rule the world

And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwiches
Transylvania crypt, let's take a tour
Bitch, try getting through that black trap door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that‚Äôll be more of a reason that you get slapped up for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? (Fuck you!)
Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy!
That little bitch keeps trying to hunt me
Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I‚Äôm allergic?!
(I like your cape!) Oh, this Bathing Ape cape?
Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp, and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can‚Äôt eat pussy 'cause I might leave cuts
Then there‚Äôs blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitch, is it hard to handle?
I don‚Äôt want a bride, I just want bone marrow (Oh shit!)
[Hook]
(It‚Äôs because) I‚Äôm Dracula, bitch!
Don‚Äôt got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It‚Äôs because) I‚Äôm Dracula, bitch!
Don‚Äôt got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula‚Äôs dick

Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats
It‚Äôs a full moon tonight, and these hoes ain‚Äôt actin' right
(It‚Äôs because) I‚Äôm Dracula, bitch! (swag, swag, swag)
(It's because) Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang...

Youre Nobody Til Somebody Kills You,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1997,302936,{},"[Produced by Jiv Poss, Puff Daddy, Stevie J and DJ Enuff]

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun-testin', coke-measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga deceased
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Faith Evans (Puff Daddy)]
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nothin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore (say what?)
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shoppin', buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Faith Evans (Puff Daddy)]
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?
Dark-skin Jermaine, see what I mean?

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Faith Evans (Puff Daddy)]
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)

Rabbit Run,rap,Eminem,2002,302634,{},"[Verse]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece
Of paper (*rip*) I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped up, oh wait, here comes somethin'
(*Crumples paper*) Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boiling point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone
By the way they're runnin', you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
""Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
He said he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest-""
I'll be back, baby I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face

Goodfellas, uh

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Now, what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah, livin' the raw deal
Three course meals: spaghetti, fettuccine, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeros over in Rio de Janeir-y
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word
Swimmin' in women with they own condominiums
Five plus five's, who drive Millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands with the cuts
In somethin' European chromed out with the clutch, what
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I wanna hold figures, fuck bein' a broke nigga
Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers (uh)
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers (c'mon)
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles (hahaha)
Enormous cream, forest green Benz jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme (that's right)
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you (uh-uh), 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picassos
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's (wooo!)
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in the chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota (uh)
Avoidin' NARCs with camcorders and Chevy Novas (uh-huh)
Stash in the building with this chick named Wilona (uh-huh)
From Daytona, when I was young, I wanted to bone her (uh-huh)
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants (hahahaha)
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, ugh (c'mon)
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown (wooo!)
Pinky-ringin', gondolas with the man singin'
Italian music down the river with your chick clingin'
To my bizzalls, player, you mad false
Actin' hard when you as pussy as RuPaul's

Floss in my 6, with the 'lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it (Uh-huh)
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deep throat it (Come on)

Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines
Get your own shit, why you ridin' mine? (Uh-huh)

Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me
In my asshole (uhh), undercover, Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (Uh-huh)
My West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that whole life, we push weight (Uh-huh)
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes in Penn State (C'mon)
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway
Playa haters, get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off 'til I'm empty, don't tempt me

I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear

Give away a few Mercedes, like, here, lady, have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so

We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now

Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!
[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you're on top there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that ‚Äì what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jamming up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer And me, the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Aiyo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip? All the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yeah, all the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yo, all the time, Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper‚Äîwhat you say, Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop
[Outro: Q-Tip]

SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back, I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting
Trigger temper, I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter, this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all
'Cause niggas like you be praying on my downfall
Hoping I flop, hoping I stop
You probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smoking the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader, what? Nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should've swallowed you
You on some tag-along, flunky yes-man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no, fuck it, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel, fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal, then that bitch is a fool
How come? You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, 'fore I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'mma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like ""Dammit, this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures

Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain‚Äôt a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph

[Verse 1]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad, throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo', hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by N.W.A
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there, cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
""It's all about makin' that GTA""

'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that beat!
Mothafucka, say what?

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man J.D. is on freebase
The boy J.D. was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car, tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard

I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh, brother
I'll throw it in the gutter and go buy another.""
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in

Said: ""Next time you blog, try to spit a flow.""
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'

I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo Rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost

Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute

Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table

However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it

She told him, ""Get off it,"" and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
""To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain"" ‚Äî take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
""How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?""
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, ""What you doing, G?""
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!""
Looser than a pair of Adidas

Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out ‚Äî one, two, three ‚Äî no bodies, please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war

A whole string of jobs like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store

There, it is done

Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down ‚Äî never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty ‚Äî that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though ‚Äî maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck ‚Äî I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too""
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now
[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big Boi]
It's like that, now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha... Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, ""What you wanna be?"" She said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now

I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

[Intro - over Sample]
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)

Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coup√© switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, ""Look at Niggaraci"" - hello

I want the finer things in my life

Marcy, Brooklyn... yeah

I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Mo√´t
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?

I'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?

What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up!
Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement

No! Raggedy Andy and Andy

Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed

'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee

Six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And Glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th

Fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way

Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? ""Headed off to?"" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco

Lookin' for me? I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now

Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit

So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vain
Covers talkin' now the feds say I'm insane
A psych said ""I'm going fumble [down on the platter ?]""
And then his son told me ""Put down the drink dawg""
I got the rinks off, coming for the things off
I guess there's nothin' and I'm finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
Stomping on someone, with my boots
And I'll put it off, if we modest
And every other god need a goddess
And every other star, couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us

I can sell a phone, guess I was different
That was somethin' back then, that was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound alike
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic?
I don't even sound right, feelin' like I'm on the downright
And these niggas are secondary, like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light

So I pass that dick around like a collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday, with the fuss you made
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit don't plan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
Mommas on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two more shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm ""That nigga""
Or maybe if I'm humble, it's not a cellphone finger
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit is thinner
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should know somethin' different, I could reconsider
Got something nothing seri' till the cellphone liver
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no more liver
I can stand and deliver 'til they pump my liver
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, kinda self, but I'm fine
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud [?]
And I could style on [?], hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm out of your league
I'm liable to be a liability'
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like [?]
[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Hook 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
Where the fuck I'm going? Nah, nigga fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can something don't ask
Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the planning
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And an afternoon I annex
And all of the damage
Left on the platter
Who's soon after all, I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun, cause I have to ball
I run the world, cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' and I got it all
And you feeling like you got it all?
Humble some' [Non-Lyrical Vocals]
Nah nigga, not at all

[Hook]
Worry 'bout me, don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'cha gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]
There's something on the all out, the call out, somethin' on the doormat
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense nothing to something, what y'all 'bout?
Bumping nothing to something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, I don't fuck around
Put everything on the something, then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, from bumping expressionless
I was under exodus and learning what the lessons is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the sedatives
One sip and then it'll have you look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
But understand [?]
[?] put hands on you, then put his front side, and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I can state something if

[Hook]
They worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can [?] when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

Bomb First My Second Reply,rap,2Pac,1996,292135,{Outlawz},"[Intro: Press Release]
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's ‚Äì excuse me ‚Äì Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac ‚Äì rather Makaveli ‚Äì was not available for comment but released this statement:

[Spoken: 2Pac]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‚Äòcause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, (huh) in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ‚Äôem
Cut ‚Äôem down, to Hell is where we send ‚Äôem
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters""
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free ‚Äì bomb first
[Chorus: 2Pac]
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? Narcing service
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch!
[Bridge: 2Pac]
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga!

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
""King of New York"" like you the motherfuckin' one?
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin‚Äô chips
Gettin‚Äô rich, even though it's hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‚Äòcause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time

[Outro: 2Pac]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, but bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin' it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases

So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ¬Ω Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major

Power to the people at last, it‚Äôs a new hour
Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols
But you could 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral
Hanh! Take the power in your own hands
I‚Äôm a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don‚Äôt stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I‚Äôm on my Van Gogh, I don‚Äôt hear shit
[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours (Ey-yeah!)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)

Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'ma drop 'em in Islam
They say ""As-salamu alaykum"", say ""Wa alaikum as-salaam""
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we gon' stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, 'cause you know he drop bombs

Ayo Yeezy, man, stop playing with these people, man
They want see you act all crazy in this motherfucker, man

What do it mean to be the boss? (Oh!)
It mean second place is the first one who lost (Oh!)
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross (Oh!)

Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh? (Woo!)
Eating Wheaties, drinkin' Fiji, being greedy, huh (C-c-c)
Don‚Äôt even think you can allude to the rumors (C'mon!)

And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I‚Äôm the one that got away (Woo!)

Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?

Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely

A tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon' cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love, you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby

Toronto, I got you

Yeah

[Verse 1 - Drake]
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it ""playing checkers""
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, I'll be happy to connect you
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, ""Just write every single thing you need down""
And he got it for me, and I'm as happy can be now
'Bout to start balling like I'm coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack‚Äîbag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
'Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You ain't heard of me, then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF, but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see 'em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see
(No homo, though)

Yeah
Um...
I'm going in

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Drizzy, I got us, this is my promise
I'ma bring that barrel to them bitches' eyeliners
And what I make up would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck, then buck-buck again
I would buttfuck your friend, then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now, don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo, I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, 'cause bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf, hoodie too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker, the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you; no, I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone, like a dog, motherfucker
I am going for your neck in a sec
Intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup, I am headed to the buck
Like, buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A. and just fuck Karrine
Nahh, fuck Karrine! Let's get bucks again
And fucking spend them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you, I'ma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, 'bout to pop it, let's get it
Let's get it, motherfucker, what you waiting on?
It is 'bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the ""it"" you want me with
And I probably just spit on the chick you want be with
And I hate a bony bitch, only like 'em only thick
And I own hip-hop; if you don't spit, I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like ""Drake Drizzy Rogers""
Or ""Drizzy Drake Rogers,"" I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game, I'm too willing to play harder
So harder, I go, there he go
They chant ""MVP"" when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jaz, what it do?
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you, I get paid by the letter, like:
""A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y""
ZZ Top, yes, he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a footnote; how long can he could go?
Wondering when he stop? Bitch, when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rocking 'til the sheet rock bend

I miss the days when this was fun, but now, it turned into work
And getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
(As you should, that shit's outrageous)
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my muh'fuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets dis-gur-sting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck (I'm here to talk to you)
I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
(Who, Travis?)
Niggas saying ""Free Earl"" without even knowin' him

So while my wallets piling with symbolic-colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
Twenty, why didn't she get that abortion?

Into a Grammy-winning, schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops! I mean ""bastard,"" (Yeah) skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her master's
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard (Yeah?)
Start a fucking cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher

So they tied the knot; now it‚Äôs too late to reverse this arrangement

Just 'cause honeys wanna give me the butt, what? (All I want)

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm gettin' at shorty like, ""What you need? What you want?"" (Huh?)
Want for nothin', 'cause I got you, but you front (True)
I see you with your baby father, but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter (Woah)
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I've done kept it more than real, boo, can't lose with me (True)
Heard he smacked you 'cause you said my name while y'all was sexin' (Woah)
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin' (Uh)
You know I ain't even with that, so he gon' have to get that just on GP
Try to creep me (What?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, well, that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to 1-5-0, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, and we can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff a L, forget that, you with that?
[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]
What type of games are bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want)

[Verse 3: DMX]
Ayy, yo, this chicken got me diggin' her moves 'cause she's smooth
Win or lose, whoever she choose, gets the dues (Aight)
Respect is not expected, but it's given 'cause it's real (Uh)
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal (True)
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if he squeal for me
Kill for me, you're still with me?
'Cause we get down, like, ""What?""
Told you's from the door, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, tryin' to be there, we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, boo, that answer gon' be ""Yeah""
See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go, and it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me (Uh-uh)
She had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me (Uh-uh)
But we gon' always be best of friends (Ha-ha)
Mad love, boo, 'til the end (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]
What type of games are bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want)

Tyler, we, ah, I know it's short notice, but I brought all your friends here
For some reason, I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends here to talk to you
Because they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow!
Thus, another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back (Wolf)
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs (Aah!)
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several, but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says ""Fuck 'em!"" on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter, that's where I'm at (Where we at?)
Now, where we at? Where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at? (Wolf Gang)

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? Where we at? Where we‚Äì
We on top of the world, on top of the world
Nigga, top of the world
[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane?
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at, nigga? Where we at, nigga?
Uh, we on top of the world, on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Where we at, where we at, niggas? Where we at?
Where the fuck we at, man? Y'all niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler, The Creator]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying ""Fuck everybody"", I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book, and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home, but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and David are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but they're complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
""Can we get backstage, man?"" ‚Äî No, faggot, it's sold out!
""Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change its spots!""
But I'm a fucking unicorn! ‚Äî Whatever, man
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach ""Fuck age, live dreams and have fun""
""Here‚Äôs some 'Give a Fuck' cake"" ‚Äî Oh, maybe I should have some
""Asshole, have none!""
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
(""Shit, I don't know"")
When I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me...
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero, and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building!

It seems like they all want me to fail
But I‚Äôm not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don‚Äôt want me to fail
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm not going back
Not going back

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I could've been a tragedy
That‚Äôs why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
‚ÄòCause they ain‚Äôt have the smarts or the heart
Ain‚Äôt you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith, that‚Äôs Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I‚Äôm rapping, that‚Äôs hating
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y‚Äôall saying?
Step inside the party, y‚Äôall niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple: Live easy and Bruce Willis
I‚Äôm the boss, Michael Scott, y‚Äôall bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y‚Äôall motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That‚Äôs why these fucking emcees want their asses back
Don‚Äôt you know that I‚Äôm a rapist? Ask a track
Whiskey sipping, wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fucking hate me, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
God damn, man, there‚Äôs gotta be a better way
Than pill-popping all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I‚Äôm Jessie in this bitch, I‚Äôm so excited
There‚Äôs a party at the top, you ain‚Äôt invited
But it‚Äôs lame, and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up‚Äôs a mistake
Black dudes assume I‚Äôm closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off

Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothing against the sisters, I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre into me
I am not a thug, AKA: what they pretend to be
I am just myself, AKA: my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fucking knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It‚Äôs cool though, it‚Äôs all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I‚Äôm sorry, babe, but I act me
I don‚Äôt ""act black,"" whatever that be
I‚Äôm just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they're looking for some In-N-Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread‚Äîmaking sandwiches
That‚Äôs why you niggas fail like all of your parents‚Äô marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we‚Äôre better off, you‚Äôre welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that?
Like that bullshit, you talked before Culdesac
""I didn‚Äôt know he had it in him""
Couldn‚Äôt see me as Spider-Man, but now I‚Äôm spittin‚Äô venom
Now you payin‚Äô attention, pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero, I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because

These fake sounds

L'encre coule, le sang se r√©pand ; la feuille buvard
Absorbe l'√©motion, sac d'images dans ma m√©moire
Je parle de ce que mes proches vivent et de ce que je vois :
Des mecs coul√©s par le d√©sespoir qui partent √† la d√©rive
Des mecs qui pour 20 000 de shit se d√©chirent
Je parle du quotidien, √©coute bien, mes phrases font pas rire
Rire, sourire, certains l'ont perdu
Je pense √† Momo qui m'a dit ""√† plus"" ; jamais je ne l'ai revu
Tenter le diable pour sortir de la gal√®re, t'as gagn√© fr√®re
Mais c'est toujours la mis√®re pour ceux qui poussent derri√®re
Pousse, pousser au milieu d'un champ de b√©ton
Grandir dans un parking et voir les grands faire rentrer les ronds
La pauvret√©, √ßa fait gamberger, en deux temps, trois mouvements
On coupe, on compresse, on d√©coupe, on emballe, on vend
A tour de bras, on fait rentrer l'argent, on craque
Ouais, c'est √ßa la vie, et parle pas de RMI ici ici
Ici, le r√™ve des jeunes c'est la Golf GTI, survet' Tacchini
Tomber les femmes √† l'aise comme Manny
Sur Scarface, je suis comme tout le monde : je d√©lire bien
Dieu merci, j'ai grandi, je suis plus malin, lui il cr√®ve √† la fin
La fin, la faim, la faim justifie les moyens, quatre, cinq coups malsains
Et on tient jusqu'√† demain, apr√®s on verra bien
On marche dans l'ombre du Malin du soir au matin
Tapis dans un coin, couteau √† la main, bandit de grand chemin
Chemin, chemin, y en a pas deux pour √™tre un dieu
Frapper comme une enclume, pas tomber les yeux, l'envieux toujours en veut
Une route pour y entrer, deux pour s'en sortir, 3/4 cuir
R√©ussir, s'√©vanouir, devenir un souvenir
Souvenir, √™tre si jeune, en avoir plein le r√©pertoire
Des gars ray√©s de la carte qu'on efface comme un tableau, tchpaou ! C'est le noir
Croire en qui, en quoi ? Les mecs sont tous des miroirs
Vont dans le m√™me sens, veulent s'en mettre plein les tiroirs
Tiroir, on y passe notre vie, on y finit
Avant de conna√Ætre l'enfer sur terre, on construit son paradis
Fiction, d√©sillusion trop forte, sors le chichon
La r√©alit√© tape trop dur, besoin d'√©vasion
Evasion, √©vasion, effort d'imagination, ici tout est gris :
Les murs, les esprits, les rats la nuit
On veut s'√©chapper de la prison, une aiguille passe, on passe √† l'action
Fausse diversion, un jour tu p√®tes les plombs
Les plombs, certains chanceux en ont dans la cervelle
D'autres se les envoient pour une poign√©e de biftons guerre fraternelle
Les armes poussent comme la mauvaise herbe
L'image du gangster se propage comme la gangr√®ne s√®me ses graines
Graines, graines, graine de d√©linquant qu'esp√©riez-vous ? Tout jeunes
On leur apprend que rien ne fait un homme √† part les francs
Du franc-tireur discret au groupe organis√©, la racine devient champ
Trop grand, impossible a arr√™ter
Arr√™t√©, poisseux au d√©part, chanceux √† la sortie
On prend trois mois, le bruit court, la r√©putation grandit
Les barreaux font plus peur, c'est la routine, vulgaire √©pine
Fine esquisse √† l'encre de Chine, figurine qui parfois s'anime
S'anime, anim√© d'une furieuse envie de monnaie
Le noir tomb√©, qu'importe le temps qu'il fait, on jette les d√©s, faut flamber
Perdre et gagner, rentrer avec quelques papiers en plus
√áa aidera, personne demandera d'o√π ils sont tomb√©s
Tomber ou pas, pour tout, pour rien, on prend le risque, pas grave cousin
De toute fa√ßon dans les deux cas, on s'en sort bien
Vivre comme un chien ou un prince, y'a pas photo
On fait un choix, fait griller le gigot, briller les joyaux
Joyaux, un r√™ve, plein les poches mais la cible est trop loin, la fl√®che
Ricoche, le diable rajoute une encoche, trop moche, les mecs cochent
Leur propre case, d√©coche pour du cash, j'entends les cloches, √† coups de pioche
Creuser un trou, c'est trop fastoche
Fastoche, facile le blouson du bourgeois docile
Des m√©m√©s la hantise et porcelaine dans le pare-brise
Tchac ! Le rasoir sur le sac √† main, par ici les talbins
√áa c'est toute la journ√©e, lendemain apr√®s lendemain
Lendemain ? C'est pas le probl√®me, on vit au jour le jour
On n'a pas le temps ou on perd de l'argent, les autres le prennent
Demain, c'est loin, on n'est pas press√©, au fur et √† mesure
On avance en surveillant nos fesses pour parler au futur
Futur, le futur ne changera pas grand-chose, les g√©n√©rations prochaines
Seront pires que nous, leur vie sera plus morose
Notre avenir, c'est la minute d'apr√®s, le but, anticiper
Pr√©venir avant de se faire clouer
Clouer, clou√©s sur un banc, rien d'autre √† faire, on boit de la bi√®re
On siffle les gazi√®res qui n'ont pas de fr√®re
Les murs nous tiennent comme du papier tue-mouches
On est l√†, jamais on s'en sortira, Satan nous tient avec sa fourche
Fourche, enfourcher les risques, seconde apr√®s seconde
Chaque occasion est une pierre de plus ajout√©e √† nos frondes
Contre leurs lasers, certains d√©sesp√®rent, beaucoup touchent terre
Les obstin√©s refusent le combat suicidaire
Sid√®re, sid√©r√©s, les dieux regardent l'humain se diriger
Vers le mauvais c√¥t√© de l'√©ternit√© d'un pas ferme et d√©cid√©
Pr√©f√©rant r√¥der en bas en haut, on va s'emmerder
Y a qu'ici que les anges vendent √† fumer
Fum√©e, encore une bouff√©e, le voile est tomb√©
La t√™te sur l'oreiller, la merde un instant estomp√©e
Par la fen√™tre, un cri fait son entr√©e, un homme se fait braquer
Un enfant se fait serrer, pour une Cartier, menott√©
Menott√©, pieds et poings li√©s par la fatalit√©
Prisonnier du donjon, le destin est le ge√¥lier
Le turf, l'ar√®ne, on a grandi avec les jeux
Gladiateur courageux, mais la vie est coriace, on lutte comme on peut

Dans les constructions √©lev√©es
Incompr√©hension, bandes de gosses soi-disant mal √©lev√©s
Frictions, excitation, patrouilles de civils

Economie parall√®le, √©quipe dure comme un roc
Petits Don qui contr√¥lent grave leurs spots
On p√®te la Veuve Cliquot, parqu√©s comme √† Mexico
Horizons ciment√©s, pickpockets, toxicos
Personnes honn√™tes ignor√©es, superflics, Zorros
Politiciens et journalistes en visite au zoo
Musulmans respectueux, p√®res de famille humbles
Baffles qui blastent ma musique de la jungle
Entr√©es d√©vast√©es, carcasses de tires √©clat√©es
Nu√©e de gosses qui viennent gratter
Lumi√®res oranges qui s'allument, chemin√©es qui fument
Parties de foot improvis√©es sur le bitume
Golf VR6, pneus qui crissent
Silence bris√© par les sir√®nes de la police
Polos Fa√ßonnable, surv√™tements minables
M√®res aux traits de caract√®re admirables
Chichon bidon, histoires de prison
Stupides divisions, amas de tisons
Ou clich√©s d'Orient, cuisine au piment
Jolis noms d'arbres pour des b√¢timents dans la for√™t de ciment
D√©sert du midi, soleil √©crasant
Vie la nuit, pendant le mois de Ramadan
Pas de distractions, se cr√©er un peu d'action
Jeu de d√©s, de contr√©e, paris d'argent, m√©chante attraction
Rires ininterrompus, arrestations impromptues
Maires d'arrondissement corrompus
Marcher sur les seringues usag√©es, r√™ver de voyager
Autoradios en affaire, lot de cha√Ænes arrach√©es
Bougre sans retour, psychopathe sans piti√©
Meilleurs liens d'amiti√© qu'un type puisse trouver
G√©nies du sport faisant leurs classes sur les terrains vagues
Nouvelles blagues, terribles techniques de drague
Individualit√©s qui craquent parce que stress√©es
Personne ne bouge, personne ne sera bless√©
Vapeur d'√©ther, d'eau √©carlate, d'alcool
Fourgon de la Brink's mat√© comme le pactole
C'est pas dr√¥le, le chien mord enferm√© dans la cage
Bave de rage, les barreaux grimpent au deuxi√®me √©tage
Dealer du hashich, c'est sage si tu veux sortir la femme
Si tu plonges, la ferme, y'a pas de drame
Mais l'√©cole est pas loin, les ennuis non plus
√áa commence par des tapes au cul, √ßa finit par des gardes √† vue
Regarde la rue, ce qui change ? Y a que les saisons
Tu baves du b√©ton, craches du b√©ton, chies du b√©ton
Te bats pour du laiton, mais est-ce que √ßa rapporte ?
Regrette pas les biftons quand la BAC frappe √† la porte
Trois couleurs sur les affiches nous traitent comme des bordilles
C'est pas Manille, ok, mais les cigarettes se torpillent
Coupable innocent, √ßa parle cash, de pour cent
Oeil pour oeil, bouche pour dent, c'est stressant
Tr√®s t√¥t, c'est d√©j√† la famille dehors, la bande √† Kader
""Va niquer ta m√®re !"": la merde au cul, ils parlent d√©j√† de travers
Pas facile de parler d'amour, travail √† l'usine
Les belles gazelles se brisent l'√©chine dans les cuisines
Les √©lus ressassent r√©novation, √ßa rassure
Mais c'est toujours la m√™me merde derri√®re la derni√®re couche de peinture
Feu les r√™ves gisent enterr√©s dans la cour
A douze ans, conduire, mourir, finir comme 2Pac Shakur
Mater les photos, majeur aujourd'hui, poto
Pas mal d'amis se sont d√©j√† tu√©s en moto
Une fois tu gagnes, mille fois tu perds : le futur c'est un loto
Pour ce, je d√©die mes textes en qualit√© d'ex-voto, mec
Ici t'es jug√© √† la r√©putation forte
Manque-toi et tous les jours les bougres pissent sur ta porte
C'est le tarif minimum et gaffe
Ceux qui p√®sent transforment le secteur en oppidum
Gel√©, l'ambiance s'√©lectrise, y a plein de places assises
B√©ton fig√© fait office de froide banquise
Les gosses veulent sortir, les ""non"" tombent comme des massues
Les artistes de mon cul pompent les subventions DSU
Tant d'√©nergie perdue pour des pr√©jug√©s indus
Les d√©cideurs financiers, pleins de merde dans la vue
En attendant, les espoirs foirent, capotent, certains rappent
Les pierres partent, les caisses vol√©es d√©rapent

An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded

My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted

It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason, I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about

For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life

There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life

It's funny
Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, tryna find something

What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some fa√ßade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say: ""where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you to say: ""sign an autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, ""It wasn't me, I got a twin""
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, ""Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed""
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, ""What up? It's nice to meet ya"" (Hi)
""I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me""
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
""I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now""
She said, ""Come in, it's unlocked""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, ""Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, ""Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best""
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)
[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere

""Fuck 'em all!""'s what I'm chanting, don't complain, I'm just ranting

Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies (Fucking fairies)
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitch teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis (Nazis), black Nazis don't copy (Copy)
We perfect, you sloppy (Sloppy), hotter than Saki Takei (Takei)
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett (Bitch)
Hang with thrashers and jackers, drug dealers and crackers
AP students and slackers, I'm backwards
Like Jermaine Dupri in '93, escaping from concentration camps
With a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress (Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress, bitch)
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me (Yup)
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That‚Äôs for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie (Auntie)

Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be (Can't be, heh)
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot (Faggot, ayy)

From Los Ange' area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck (Fuck) 2DopeBoyz and NahRight

Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciga-weed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfucking little league
No, I'm not no fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies (Fuck buddies, O-F)

Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk (Uh!)

December 4th,rap,JAY-Z,2003,283714,{},"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on
[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‚ÄòCause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...",15,en,en,en

I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it felt
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground

On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never would've rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact

Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say
You should say it right now
You should say it right now
You ready?

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I deserve it, I think I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I can't take it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I know you once said to me
""This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be""
Time is only wastin', so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it
We should do it right now
We should do it right now
Baby, uh
[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Drake]
You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
I deserve it, I know I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah
Sing...
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...

Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo!
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
Back in the days, I'm 8 now
Makin' a tape now, Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!)
Fuck that!

Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
(Dedicated to MPV's: phat!)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah (Raekwon)]
Kickin' the fly clich√©s, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime

So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right

After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane

But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody

And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga, please, how you gon' say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head?
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard 'til your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red

Top five MCs, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big, you can't sit behind me

Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb‚Äî
I'm riding shotgun""

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
[Chorus]
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Shit, oh well, oh well,"" ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me...""

You'd be singin' to her
Like, ""La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da""

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Okay, I don't believe it""
I say ""Nope, I swear, I never do it""
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend""

Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair

Unconditional Love,rap,2Pac,1998,279822,{},"[Intro]
(What y'all want?)
Unconditional love (no doubt)
Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you, still feel you
Still there for you, no matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love

[Verse 1]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don‚Äôt need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'
In my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love
[Chorus]
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse 2]
Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
[Chorus]
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse 3]
I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I know one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
[Chorus] (repeat to fade)
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love",6591,en,en,en

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Cazal shades and corn braids?
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993

Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
'Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Totin' TECs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day

For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrappin'
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake

Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain

[Verse 3]
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a ki, knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin' crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Goin' out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Every time I turn around, a nigga gettin' took out
Shit, my mama got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed
[Chorus]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?

Buggin Out,rap,A Tribe Called Quest,1991,277696,{},"[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out
[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man

But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

[Verse 1]
Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives ‚Äòcause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me ‚Äòcause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch‚ÄîI betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

[Verse 2]
You leave your kids with your mama
‚ÄòCause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex?
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
‚ÄòCause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch‚ÄîI betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
‚ÄòCause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, ‚Äòcause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? ‚ÄòCause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitch‚ÄîI betcha!
[Chorus]
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch

Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches

Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So e'erybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

[Verse 1]
Man, first of all; I'm a boss, I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates, and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who's the man now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own

And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow, I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta (Woo)
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' ""Die Santa""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders (Yeah)
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul, and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's, from the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So, ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

Now whether you're black, white, or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

[Verse 3]
Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot, 'cause, girl‚ÄîI got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell you now, I'm so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car

There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put my chips on the worse bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off, ended it and dipped
And if you spoke soft, we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway

Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?

Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical

Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping

Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock

Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life, it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to, but I do
Yeah, I say it now when you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now?
But somehow, I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
To them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
Minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now‚ÄîJesus!
And everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
Man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has a way of affectin' everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck I'm s'posed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Doody, I drop a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missin' DeShaun
Holton, it was written, it was woven
For a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're sayin', ""Keep goin'!
Be a man! No emotion! It's your duty!""
Until we meet again, Doody
[Verse 2: Eminem]
""Doody,"" that's what we'd call each other
I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
It was like ninety degrees, I was catchin' a sunburn
Tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moanin', I just wanna get home and
I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like, ""You're gonna fry,"" you're like, ""No, I won't
I'm black, stupid! And black people they got melatonin
In their skin‚Äîwe don't burn,"" meanwhile my face is glowin'
And I feel like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughin' at me
And snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way, them Playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well, Nate finally got 'em back, shit
It must've been at least 16 years ago
Well, I put 'em in your cask‚Äîoww
Movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop, dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like ""Fuck rap!""
It feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
Don't ever give up the dream, dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together
Who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker, Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin' cars to paintballin', gettin' arrested
To sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and‚Ä¶ what's his face? I forgot his fuckin' name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
And that‚Äôs on Hailie Jade, Whitney Laine and Alaina‚Äôs name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
In the air for you and pour some liquor out
With Obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
We were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more

Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‚Äòcause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?

Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes

Niggas couldn‚Äôt do nothing with me, they put the devil on me

Fuck all these fairytales
Go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y‚Äôall interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It‚Äôs amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red-hot
I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet‚Äîkeep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it

Never let it be said I didn‚Äôt win

Rhymes Like Dimes,rap,MF DOOM,1999,272968,{Bobbito},"[Intro]
Ayo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum, close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

[Verse 1]
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
Saying, electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slid into the shitter,  thought I killed her goose
Her Power U's was pure Brita water filter juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

[Verse 2]
Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
""Oh, you're too kind!"" ""Really? Thanks!""
To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine""
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her, ""No credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gack""
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes

You Never Know,rap,Immortal Technique,2003,271177,"{""Jean Grae""}","[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
She was on her way to becomin' a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids
But the rich sniff-coke kids got no play
""I'm not even interested"" is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick
Smokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‚Äòcause you never know

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about power to the people and such
We spent more time together, but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel
I was too interested in keepin' it real
Perfectly honest and complete
She would always call me ""cari√±o"" and never Technique
Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks
Forever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets
To stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears
But honey's only response was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‚Äòcause you never know

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole
In the summer, came back, intact and on track
But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold
Even after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home
My real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone
Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine
Stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed
When I asked about her daughter
[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‚Äòcause you never know

[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]
She told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind
And she had left it there waitin' for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope
With my name on the floor: ""Nobody loves you more than me, cari√±o,"" is what the letter said
""By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me to see what true love really does
‚ÄòCause even though we never made love
You were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought
You made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby, don't you see?
I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hope didn't exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.""
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond
‚ÄòCause you never really know what you got until it's gone",2282,en,en,en

I Have a Dream,misc,Martin Luther King Jr.,1963,269062,{},"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.

Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.

We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.

As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""For Whites Only."" We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.

I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.""

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, ""My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.""

And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!
Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!

Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!

But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!

Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!

Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.

And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!""",4757,en,en,en

Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can‚Äôt rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin

I'ma show you how I be livin'

Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

Something about it, man
Same song and dance

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, ‚ÄúWell, hello Tonya‚Äù
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, ""Exact opposites attract""
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on
[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you

It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing

Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
""Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt!
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done""
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord
[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell like, ""Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do""

Friends

[Verse]
As you call 'em, they call you when they need something
Trees for the bluntin', to G's for the frontin'
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies
Close, or really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays, he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn‚Äôt even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: ""No feeding the baboons""
Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance
Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
(How many of us have them?) A show of hands
(Friends) is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crew see
You telling me; I try to act broke
Jealousy the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend
It said: ""person one likes to socialize with
Sympathizer, helper"", and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
(Flick!) And when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot
I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel
When it get for real, steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken, it ain't no talkin'
For somethin' so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is
(One's we can depend on, friends)
Some come in the form of co-dependents
A lot of times only end up being co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, begging for repentance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust among royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze than give 'em the glory
(How many of us have‚Äî) a similar story?
(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing
Just so when I let her get the man thing
She know it's no strings, we could do the damn thing
But ho, it's no rings, just how the tramp swings
Will she see him again? That depends on
""How good was the skins?"" and ""Could she memorize the lessons?""
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let him stab it, she know they're just friends

I‚Äôd hope we‚Äôd never hear from him

I first met DOOM years ago
When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments
One day while conducting a secret experiment
[Explosion sounds] Later, when he recovered from his injuries
Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful
[Woman screams] What have I done to myself?
My face, it is hideous
He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face
(I‚Äôm sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)
He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen
He continued his search, never showing his face

I'm trill, working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow Tuss'
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Some niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas, they want it, want it
Some niggas, they jon'ing, jon'ing, but I be fucked up, up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't 'bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high, we gon' get high, and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night, and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie-fruit
Forty dollars for just one ounce, Tussionex is how it's pronounced

People always asking me, ""Is the Three 6 high on that?""
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Wh-wh-where the weed at? Ain't like that, we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella-yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, ""What's up, fool?"" Vocal cords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter-pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my weekly high, gotta have that drank
Yeah, my nig', y'ain't know? I feel like I'm gon' fucking faint

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Nigga, tell me what you know 'bout Frank, Nito, and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune that's sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 niggas pouring up, that's my Southern credo
Quick, fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Bido
'Cause you fronting rap singers, be creamy like a Zinger (Zinger)
You ain't from the manger, boy, but you gets the middle finger (Finger)

Occasionally take your bitch to the telly and be a dick-and-cum slanger
When Big Bun come, danger, nigga, ring your alarm
Sexy thing on my arm, cup of drank in my palm

Yeah
Told you we'd be back
Welcome to Hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold, I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirtin' a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck all
Other words, I ain't put a dent in the game compared to the damage I've yet to do
As long as you still have feelings to hurt, I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
As long as I got two balls to palm, I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm
Get scant, little piss-ants, and see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet with a tornado's the kinda brainstorm I get
So when wind starts blowin‚Äô shit
Talk about goin‚Äô in? Goin‚Äô insane‚Äôs more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast don't miss it
Yeah, go ahead, little, prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick-ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes in it
Just know that all he knows is that it's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick Dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity, unmatched it has to be stopped but it can't be
But man I can't just keep doin' 'em like that or no one'll rap with me
Except one‚Äîyou asked who is it?
[Verse 2: Royce da 5‚Äô9‚Äù]
Guess who just came through to blast you bitches?
With the ratchet, the book of Matthew, a book of matches
Lighting 'em under white linen
You 'bout to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, asked you, spit it
And you got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands
I'm sure they gon' laugh when you're going to the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us?
Better be somethin' with a Bigfoot pedigree
Easily, these are the reasons that we need to be in y'all prayers
Each region breeds them, MCs that wanna be the remise
That they wanna breathe our air, with these ideas
Anybody thinkin' the game don't need the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like saying that the Bad Boy Piston team didn't need Isiah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shit, piss, and bleed, this is a different breed of MCs, I swear
Better beware, there's too much at stake and to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and eat shit stains out my underwear that I don‚Äôt even wear

[Verse 4: Royce da 5‚Äô9‚Äù]
This gotta be no fair, it's like hitting the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got'll lobotomy your hair
Classic, smash it, smother it, read it and weep then
Perhaps you will have no rebuttal and
In fact, you seein' me in this rappin' is like saying
Tila Tequila can sing like Jazmine Sullivan
[Verse 5: Eminem]
Back to bash your skull again, push a bitch out the Aspen
And tell her get the fuck outta Dodge (Dodge Aspen)
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than color books that ain‚Äôt colored in
Second and third, fourth wind, got another wind
Here they come again, none other than Bad and Evil
Also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time, but I bet that neither one of us
Have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fuckin' shit up on the dime
So telling us to pipe down is like talking to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fightin' it while he's watchin' internet porn, 'bout to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is David Carradine jackin' his penis in front of his tripod, choking his own neck
What part you don't get? I'm saying I die hard!

[Verse 6: Royce da 5‚Äô9‚Äù & Eminem]
When you listening to my bars, nothing but the F-I-R-E
Coming out your iPod, we come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinnin' like motherfuckin' white walls
Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other, we punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say, ""I'm so‚Äìrry,"" the 5‚Äô9‚Äù and the Fire Marshall
We spit with an intensity to shut shit down
In the industry, two different entities with a propensity
To put these N-U-Ts up inside of your fuckin' mouth

Chill with your old lady at the tilt

Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick

When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said

I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ‚Äôcause no father figure

I'm a feminine Eminem, a slim shady lady
But nice, 'cause I texted Haiti
90 lady cops in the road
And I'm arrested for doing 80
Like Hamlet, all about ""words, words, words""
Divide a whole into thirds, thirds, thirds
I'm a gay sea otter:
I blow other dudes out of the water
I'm the man muffin, diving, muffin'
Cold and fly like an arctic puffin
Puffing whacky tobaccy
Hating other rappers like I'm Helga Pataki
And I've been rocking this mic before electricity
Way back in 1000 BCE -
That's before the common era (era, era, era, era, era, era, ah)
I can't be stopped
Flow so sick that it should be mopped up
Chick's got a dixie cup
I gotta dick full of helium; I'll fuck you up
A boy, a girl, a middle aged bitch
Botox in the third person
I give the perspective a switch and
Bo talks in the third person
Ooh, just relax; if you wanna know me, here's two facts

I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypo-crite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite

Met a girl named Macy, had sex with her all day
But she was dyslexic, so I ended up doing the YMCA
We ballin', Asian, Wii bowling,
Prostate cancer semi-colon
Find that hole like I'm Stephen Hawking
Atticus Finch, killing, mocking
Cry like a child would
You raped my childhood
Just stroll in, roll in your pole into Rolie Polie Olie's colon
To relax my mind
I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time and
Rhyming, mathematical timing
Syntax impacts the intact hymen
I'm an internet provider
Came from the web like a horny spider
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard
Then came in cider
I thought AIDS was a butt virus
Like conjunction junction conjunctivitis
I spit gold bars 'cause I was
Molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker
Oedipus was the first motherfucker

I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite
Hungry hungry hippo-crite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite

We the people of the USA
Jos√©, we're not talking to you, es√©
We got a border in order to keep you out
It's what my NYU essay's about
'Cause we're, xenophobic warrior princess
Molested by my Uncle Sam, is that incest?
""I WANT YOU"" to smell my finger
Does my nephew's scent still linger?
South of queers, north of hell
The queer ones suck and the brown ones smell
We guard the border and we guard it well
But some slip through the cracks of the liberty bell
Did I say liberty? I meant taco
Paco, hey I better let that rock go
'Cause in real life Goliath wins
And then sells all the silk that the widow spins

Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It,rap,Ice Cube,2008,261698,{},"[Intro]
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!

(Maestro!!!) Blame me!
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Verse 1]
You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant
[Hook 1]
I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 2]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me ""don't say that""?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971
[Hook 2]
So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy-headed ho
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 3]
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‚ÄòCause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‚Äòcause he is my homie
[Hook 3]
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Bridge]
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow-flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Outro]
Oh yeah, and another thing
For all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap
‚ÄòCause 9 times out of 10
You don't know the fuck you talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do

To my unborn child‚Ä¶
To my unborn child
In case I don‚Äôt make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you

[Verse 1]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‚ÄòCause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child
[Hook: Natasha Walker]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‚ÄòCause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 2]
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child
[Hook: Natasha Walker]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‚ÄòCause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 3]
Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‚ÄòCause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw ‚Äì what could be worse?
‚ÄòCause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace

Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child

Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
‚ÄòCause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you‚Äôll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I‚Äôll see you if there‚Äôs a ghetto in Heaven
If there‚Äôs a Ghetto Heaven, I‚Äôll be there waitin' for you

I am a Roc representer (Oh)
Summer to winter (Oh), dead or alive (Uh)
24/7, three-sixty-five
One CD or three hundred and sixty pies
What's up to E and Kirk? Welcome home to Taj
Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours (Uh)
We run streets like drunks run streetlights
We collidin' with life as we speak
We knee-deep in coke, we key-deep in ice
We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke
We all fish, better teach your folk
Give him money to eat, the next week, he's broke
'Cause when you sleep, he's reachin' for your throat
Word on the street, you reap what you sow
Not out of fear, but love, love for the game
Roc family first, we never change, man

Where my dogs at? Where my soldiers at war?
Where your balls at? Woah, gotta pause that (Woah)

Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back
Had A1 credit, got more crack
From the first to the fifth, gave it all back

Carry a big clip that'll get niggas off me
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy

That's how it is now (Uh), that's how it always be (Uh)

Catch you slipping I'ma kill you

Keep thinking I'm candy 'til ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying ""Lord, Jesus help me"" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun till you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
'Cause I get tired of looking for ya
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me

My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains

Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha

Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
""Hey, Shorty, check it, run the bag and the dough!""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! Then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head

Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
He seemed to ignore, I said, ""Be for real!
She's not even worth it to go raw deal.""
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out
Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P

Ma said ""Wake up son, good morning""
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn, then
Paused to scratch and itch, and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it
With this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps, a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four
[Interlude]
Not like a family of four, just like...
Fuck it
You'll never listen to this shit anyways
Fuck you
Bitch
Ugh...

She said ""You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple Stores""
The basement light is darkened, the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two-percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me, murder spree, surges on with the next bitch

1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's going to be a bad boy""

Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Gun men alone, keep gun men friend

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC

To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are not counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit

I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout, shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw up your hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No, oh
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the back-up
We're not soft, so you better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

All right, now, EZ Rock
Now, when I count to three
I want you to get busy
You ready now?

Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

[Verse 1]
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital ‚Äî Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing

And you know that I‚Äôma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger

And if you look high, you'll see that I‚Äôm gon' be in it

Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, ""Don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free""
And I hate when a nigga say, ""Talk is cheap""
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art ‚Äî unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is ""Eat""
By any means, and you just sardines

What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours

And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa ‚Äî that's fucked up, haha

Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder

You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway? Better cooperate
Or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women, and men
Vrinn-vrinn!‚ÄîMotor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'? Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me; Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he's tryna roll a snowball (You don't own me)
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers, better let him go, y'all (I'm not just one of your many toys)
'Cause
[Chorus: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain
Like pool balls; you won't ever think of this shit‚Äîyeah, honey, you called?
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it; Evil‚ÄîI see
Hear, and speak it‚ÄîLady, put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every motherfuckin'
Chicken 'fore it hatches 'cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid
At me, bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it
'Til it pops up! Y'all are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you're stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out (*fart*) Huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette (Chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me so do not strut
My way, slut, because‚Äî

[Chorus: Eminem & Lesley Gore]
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
[Verse 3: Eminem]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me, ""What the fuck for?""
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it's time to put the math back into Mathers 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem‚Äîrun, boy!
Every flow, got it mastered so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank‚Äîyeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse, I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now‚Äîcan you, ho?
‚ÄúShady, I don't understand your flow‚Äù ‚Äî Understand my flow? Bitch, I flow
Like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare, stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare, and point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it, man, is there a void? All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
And remember, boys‚Äî

My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn, I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)

If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
'Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong

He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shinin', like ""Who on top of this?""
People was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin'
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin'
I'm wrestlin' with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seekin' what will transmit
The scribes can apply the transcript
Yo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable, the indisputable (What!)
We New York, the narcotics, draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips for profits
Thirsty criminals sic pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working-class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of livin' is preposterous
Stay alive? You pay or die, no options
No Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers
They both partners, they all heartless, with no conscience
Back streets stay darkened, while unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin'
You either make your way or stay sobbin'
The shiny Apple is bruised, but sweet
And if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth
Many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight the savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative grows to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance
[Chorus: Mos Def, all]
So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
The sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept
The Beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin' with one another and ghetto birds
Where waters fall from the hydrants to the gutters
The Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin'
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin' visibly shaken
Takin' them plungers
Plungin' to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure
Cats is playin' God, but havin' children by a lesser baby mother
But fuck it, we played against each other like puppets
Swearin' you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin' knowledge in jail like a blessin' in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flyin' away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everythin' is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin' it real will make you a casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like Mickey and Mallory
Not knowin' the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin' what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm askin' if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose
'Cause New York niggas actin' spoiled at shows
To the winners, the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife, the Roman Empire state
[Chorus: Common, Mos Def, all]
So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
The sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

¬°Escuchela... Respirando como yo‚Ä¶ Ojos sinceros, escondiendo pena y temor‚Ä¶ El silencio de mentira, tocando al hogar escapando sentimientos entre ella y yo‚Ä¶

[Verse 3: Common]
Yo, on The Amen, corner I stood lookin' at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to Heaven
In Hell, waitin' to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for
What I know or what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib, I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome
Listenin' to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin' down the 'jects, creatin' plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Asked my guy how he thought travelin' the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past Downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
[Chorus: Mos Def, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, all]
So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
Kiss the odds goodbye, I'm on the last train leavin'",1775,en,en,en

Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means ""suicide,"" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world, when you're the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna

For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the ""dyna"" in ""mite""
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'
This game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, ""Naw, Doody, you're not!""; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, ""Think of Hailie"" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies; and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air for her

Where Im From,rap,JAY-Z,1997,247475,{},"[Intro]
Uh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (Brooklyn)
How real is, this?
How real is, this? (Brooklyn)
Uh-huh huh  (Brooklyn)
Respect this here, check!

[Verse 1]
I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets
So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check
I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
And girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 2]
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away
And say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying
""Damn, I was just with him yesterday""
I'm a block away from hell
Not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam
Still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell
And government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question:
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know
The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 3]
Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you're four-feet or Manute size
It always starts out with three dice and ""shoot the five""
Niggas thought they deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
Where I'm from
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Ooh, Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell

Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed ""Fuck the world""
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)

Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it‚Äîit's bad for you
[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy‚Äîit's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you
[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm‚Ä¶)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)

Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)

With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears

Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‚Äòcause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I ‚Äî I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (For better days)

Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 3]
Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen', and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days
[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh

All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe

Killin' motherfuckers if I have to, peelin' caps, too
Let your niggas know I'm comin' at you

Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back

But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with him
Hit him like this and like that
Let him know that I'm lookin' for a big, fat dope sack

Crooked-ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of time
And now, they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock (So, what's up, nigga?)
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)

Look, another day, another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life, shit, aight, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call, you gon' be like, ""Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype, bet you say, ""'Le, where my flight at?""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions

And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see Heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money

Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

If I Die 2Nite,rap,2Pac,1995,244695,{},"[Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Intro: Mopreme Shakur & Dr. Dre]
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‚Äòcause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?
[Chorus: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, if I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight

[Chorus: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand; if I die tonight

[Chorus: 2Pac & Dr. Dre]
Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight

It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if You see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price You paid
Feel me like a fingertip (Fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like You
Trying not to quench Your fire with the things I do

[Verse 1: Coffee]
I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and staying candid
Reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fountain, spinning and monsooning
Grinning it's high octane, explosive how I came
Rolling down hills cause life's a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat, catch a second wind, thin is the air I breathe
Teary-eyed, nose running, wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm calling on the Savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me, my behavior had me lost at light speed

Lord, if You see me please come my way

Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like You
Trying not to quench Your fire with the things I do

[Verse 2: Bonafide]
The fear of never falling in love, and the tears after losing the feelings of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug (My life be like)
Bad characteristics covered in Christ's blood
The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
The bliss between giving my all and giving up
The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze, trying to ease my woes
In this world of sin, clothes too thin to fend
So to God I send, words of help to win
In grumblings so deep letters could never express
So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects

My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord, if You see me please come my way
Leaving bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price You paid

My heartfelt desire be more like You
Trying not to quench Your fire with the things I do

My life be like ooh aah ooh, dum dum ditty
Here come that boy from the Capitol City
Last up on the Grits new ditty
But eight bars of the truth will do (Uh)
I believe there's a bride that's stunning
And I believe in the Kingdom Coming
I believe if you seek the Truth
You don't need to look far cause it's gonna find you
So why, oh why, do I trip and stumble?
And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?
I can't believe that I'm here again....

From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy

Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy, nah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jean
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George become Dead George
Stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade
That sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror

I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said, ""I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
Oh, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said, ""You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said:

[Chorus]
""Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

[Verse 2]
Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said, ""Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life
But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice""
I told him, ""You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""

He said, ""There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back

Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""

[Verse 3]
Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills

[Chorus]
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free

Yo, check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
""I'm withholdin' my anger though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect""
That's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy, it just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage
And it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit
And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be takin' too much E

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excludin' myself 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap, I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name
[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as ""I'ma whip someone's ass""
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back
[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on
[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight
[Chorus]
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard

And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it

Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
""Hey, what's that?"", don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

Well maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises

Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell 'em both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell 'em both no moving
Sit down in the back 'cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
""Aren't you a little too young to be driving?""
Look, officer, I'm just tryna get home
""Get out the fucking car with your license and registration""
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience

Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

Pain,rap,2Pac,1994,239814,{Stretch},"[Intro: Sample from Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]
I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep ‚Äì share it with me!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker ‚Äì who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless, rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb ‚Äòcause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me ‚Äì what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family ‚Äì what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs!
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang-bangers and drive-by's
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain
[Hook]
Ohhhh‚Ä¶
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh‚Ä¶
Tired of the strain and the pain

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble every day in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches ‚Äòcause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's lookin' lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back yo, give 'em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo' ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you owe, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin' yo, there's so much pain

So tired, so tired...

I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust ‚Äì I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust ‚Äì on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‚Äòcause I ain't lookin' when I'm b-blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why? ‚ÄòCause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see, and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets, and I'll be ballin', loc
Don't let 'em make you worry, keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
Out kickin' dust up, ready to bust

Now, even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for m√©nage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'
She asked, ""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand; let me help you with a plan
While he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head‚Äîthat'll really piss him off
[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GS'ses was ambidextrous
Could've sworn her breasteses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl, you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time‚Äîyou gotta breathe!
[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like ""Peace out!""

God has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy

[Intro: 2Pac]
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', ""fuck they feelings!""
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
""Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies""
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucka, bless me, please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me
C'mon, yeah
[Bridge: 2Pac]
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy!

Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time (haha!)
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
I‚Äôm contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought‚Äôll go
Brothas gettin' shot, comin' back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

Remember what my poppa told me

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
The preacher want me buried, why? 'Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, ""honor God's people""
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
It's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say

Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud

Hallowed be Thy name

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

They Reminisce Over You T.R.O.Y.,rap,Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1992,238245,{},"[Produced by Pete Rock]

[Intro]
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast, but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose you hope the little black boy grows
Huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood, there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not-thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married and a house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's rising a chapter
D√©j√† vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God
[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this, so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese Lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing, yelling ""Good God Almighty""
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real
[Bridge 2: Pete Rock]
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way-back, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes, in any weather
My Grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, 'nough respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen
[Outro: Pete Rock]
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another

I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce (Damn)
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello (Hi)
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom with‚Äì? (Nigga, hell no!)
Fuck (Shit!) and another one, there goes another one

Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
Well maybe Cupid won't miss (Blaow!)

I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went

- Tyler, what are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Uh-umm...
- Shut the fuck- You gon'- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
- Uhh..
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I would eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch (Help me!)
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you (Help me! Help me!), ever, Sarah

Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss

Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe
But fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck
Your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody

But together we can be the perfect soulmates

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OG's in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags‚Äîwhen it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it, and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost 'em both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

[Chorus: Eminem & Knoc-turn'al]
'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)

Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)

I got people I know (The watcher)

So I suggest you lay low (I'm watching)
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I moved out of the hood for good‚Äîyou blame me?
Niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight now, I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug‚Äîhow much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip‚Äîshit, four-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you
Remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes (The watcher)

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now, we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us

No, you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
No, I gave you twenty and I ain't gon' sit here and argue with your flat-ass face, home girl

I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change

What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

[Verse 2]
If I die my niggas
Fuck it, I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces, middle finger up, fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
[Interlude: Radio Interview]
(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
""I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs""
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, so, I mean, I just-I-I got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The prot√©g√© of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black

Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, 8 0 0 4
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow

I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller she would
Want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' hoe ass like you dogged me

[Verse 3]
Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Because they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick

Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause

You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don‚Äôt ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man

[Verse 1: P. Diddy & Ginuwine]
Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life
[Chorus: Ginuwine with Mario Winans, & P. Diddy]
What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)

Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)

Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario

Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leaking in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

[Chorus: Mario Winans with Ginuwine]
Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)

How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl

For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches (Bitch!) on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick (That bitch!)
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk (Damn!)
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable (Shit!)
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits (Damn!)
Sippin' on that fine shit, I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice (C'mere)
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
""Don't stop!""‚Äîresponse I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger-lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon

When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch (C'mere), the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next (Holy)
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? (Shit!) This bitch evaporated

Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
And you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‚ÄòCause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo

Looks like it's gonna be a great day today
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight
Looky here, it's just the way the cookie tear
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list
Some even say he might need some pus-sychiatrist
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling

Mad plays the bass like the race card
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude

Dolla he can overhear the hashish fienda
He just came from over there, the grass is greener
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes
And I wish they fixed the door to the matrix, there's mad glitches
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
One thing this party could use is more... ahem
Booze, put yourself in your own shoes
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use
He only keep 'em to decorate
If you wanna peep 'em, select a date
And bring a deep check, like checkmate

Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein
On a diamond mine grind,  she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought it's too thick
His assistant said: ""DOOM, you sick,"" he said ""True"" through acoustics
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning
With micro power he's sound and right reasoning
It's easy as pi, three-point-one-four
One more one false move and they're done for‚Äî",5850,en,en,en

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk

All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (yeah), and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you
[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
(""What's, wrong?"") Now check it out

[Outro: Q-Tip]
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop

Everybody in the place ya don't stop

Trickin on me when he tell you he ain't got it
You don't get the picture? My picture's in his wallet (WOO!)
Never ever thought I would leave him alone
But I let a dog roam, now he wanna come home
But I, don't trust him, though I still love him
No longer want him, lookin at his cousin
Kinda buzzin, loose off the Goose
Got him on the chase like cranberry juice
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me (Me)
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be, baby

On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom

Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can‚Äôt fit in my pockets, but I bet that gun fit
And I‚Äôm so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho

What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho
Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'≈ìuvre around this ho

Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying

All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that

I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You should've slayed me as a baby, behavin' shadier
Than Wes Craven and you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, drunk or sober, you‚Äôll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop yo' ass
Your neck'll get snapped with bare hands; fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool, but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude, then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I'll blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back, nigga
You are not realer, in fact, you'll feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents sends me smack
And got a MAC-10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistaken me, black
Or you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit

I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could say goodbye to Hollywood
'Cause Proof and Shyne, man, shit, nothing in common
The nastiest band with gats in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse; fuck your stature, dog!
Nothing to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound

Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband then, nigga

Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

No, it can't get no better for me

I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it, either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke? You would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feeling him

It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it
Then so be it, 'cause nowadays, these kids just
Don't give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat, and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
""Oh, this my jam! This my shit!
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
'Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'Cause we don't know anymore what are hits""
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When thirteen-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our syl-la-la-bles
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc
Is in the beat, then I'm gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro'
'Cause everywhere I go they love the ""bling-bling"" flow
Bang-bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost your man a lot of dough (Oh)
The fuck am I bustin' my brain fo'?
It's just the way the game go and, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow? You bought the shit
I guess you to blame, too, I just found an angle (Hahaha)
No more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the MAC-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we impressed heaven (Haha)
No one gives a shit except
Some kids that just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chatroom or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
They said thirty's the new twenty, funny
Must mean forty's the new thirty, interesting
'Cause ever since then, it's been, in a sense, an extension
For veteran rappers that are better than half of
The shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
JAY said it's his last, then 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just lookin' for that hook (Wait, Dre, look!)
[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
'Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shawty, it's your birthday (Woo)
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, ridin' on lolos (Yeah)
Puffin' on coco, my bitch in Manolos
Don't fuck with the dodos, that's slang for dumb hoes (Oh)
I'm playin', I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked, loc
It's not a game, me, B, I ain't playin', beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway, you don't hear what I'm sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, fee-fi-fididee-yay
Just give me my check and I'll be on my way
Sunny, bunny, money and funny
You ain't even listening, and I just took your money (Ha)

There once was a time everywhere you turned ('Where you turned)
Shady-Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft (Got soft)
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off (Woo!)
Well, fuck the fuck-offs! All y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back, fresh up outta the vault
Oh! New syl-la-la-bles, eat ball, you fuck-offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm runnin' past while y'all walk

Shady made me for bringin' it back
'Fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spittin'
'Bout livin' in the motherfuckin' city you at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash‚Äîme‚Äîthat's free karma
I'm everything, anything you can never be
It's a hidden rhyme of the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine (Yeah)
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood, I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my windpipes, and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy, renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby, I want you to hate me

Shorty, I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be
'Cause, shorty, you love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

I-Self-Lord-And-Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seekin' everlastin' life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience ‚Äî the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers

Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck, plus the DJ you respect

Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage

I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts on my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire?
The burnin' truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could've conquered it

Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid

Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept

Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk chazzers

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids

While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild

Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C

And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered

But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness

Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain?
That make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time? When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with a .68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, assume to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you could be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate, and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted

Well, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylac's
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse (Uh)

Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe, to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees (Uh)
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall (Yeah)
Should already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator (Equation)

Fuck you losers
While you fake jacks, I make maneuvers

Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial (Yeah)
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow

Now, who wanna test Tical, then tes-ticles
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie

Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoke
Choke off this antidote, got you hope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt

On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

Down to the bits that I left uptown

Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her
[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?

Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand

Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez

Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?

I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began

Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead

Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve

You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)

Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry

I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)

I told 'em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
""It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

Yeah, come come now
Soul Brother No. 2, I'm the one now
Sun up to sundown, still kickin' that shit
Put your gun down
I come in peace like a extraterrestrial being
Eat me a meteor and walk across the moon barefeet
But don't nobody rhyme like this no more
Call me the 2010 Rakim
I got soul, there's more in store
Feel like a CVS, open 24
Spent nights tryin' to overshadow my shadow
For niggas tryin' to block my light like a solar eclipse
I bring a knife to a fist fight and when I cut a record
So when I cut the cheese, shit you know what it is
Mr. Absoulutely the most incredible at this
So adjust your bass, your treble and then

Finna break this blunt down and burn me up one
Then sip on this Remy 'til it turn me up some

Than it is to be complex as a lot of apartments
You niggas comedy, I'm laughing at you probably
We are not the same, there's no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And it's hard to find God when you ain't never seen him
It's pie in the sky and there's bodies on the cement
And I know you lookin' at me like, ""You don't speak English""
I bring the heat like a phoenix, a son under Phoenix sun

I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not

Johnny Blazin', nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'

Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now

Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

[Verse 1]
Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams of rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‚ÄòCause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died

Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer

Was the rough, rugged and raw: Outlaw!

[Verse 3]
""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‚Äòcause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‚Äòcause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‚Äòcause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life

I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway

And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up

Crazy In Love,rap,Eminem,2004,220045,{},"[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love
[Chorus: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Verse 1]
You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah‚Äîopen sesame, mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling‚Äîyou can't match it
I rap-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty, come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so, baby, pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating, baby?
My little friend's waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wigglin'
And your booty's shakin' like jello
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello, yeah

[Verse 2]
My equilibrium's off‚Äîmust be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man‚Äîpeople give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular‚Äîit was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name? Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and, uh, did we, um?
Of course, we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package, and I'm cool‚ÄîI immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's‚ÄîI'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello

[Verse 3]
Oh, those were the days‚Äîthey certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free‚Äîhundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus, it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly, on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now, he's doubling backwards, and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now, he's up in the bathroom, like he's busting a nat
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back!
[Chorus 2]
Girl, I don't mean any harm
All I wanted to do is just say hello
Do you happen to have anything on you
To make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink
Some are blue and some are just yellow

For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!""
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" ‚Äî Nope!
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice

So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god

Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back

Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears

And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school

When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

Whatever you want to do is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Ooh, loving you forever is what I need

I told you that story to tell you this one
Check this out, this goes out to my G

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away your clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely
[Hook: Shing02 (Richard Pryor)]
Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
(I mean that from my heart cause you make me feel good as a person)
Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, small tips on the avenue
Never wasted, all hits for a revenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for some time in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in my room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose my prerogative
There's so much love in me I got to give
[Chorus]
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
(I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person)
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
(I hope that you listen)

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Oh, how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like, I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realized that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felt a sharper love in the limelight
From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back, that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music helps carry on
Like you say, a new day will bring us tomorrow

Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 1]
First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign
When we were making out, you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way, I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off, ""Hey babe what's going on?""
""Sorry I can't make it out"", sad face emoticon
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag along
Face down, ass up, that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
""You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me!""
I'm always fucking childish, you knew that when you met me

Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am

You ain't that fine, bitch what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls, I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right, my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying ""This nigga think he all that. He fucking sucked in bed"", well uhh‚Ä¶
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it

What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch
Get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought?
And you want a m√©nage √† trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a barroom brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum, y'all
Ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap
Yeah, but I'm home
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
Let him alone, you don't wanna go eggin' him on

Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain
No oxygen‚Äîother words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop

Got it ziplocked in a bag
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high-top

I'm so bad I can bitchslap a backhanded compliment
Jackass, eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it
Like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch
I'm the king of this honkey shit
I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or a Bentley
Or a Bimmer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen
Might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face
Now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy
It's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do
And make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped
She can open a can, too
But you better hope you can handle the heat
Or stay the fuck outta Hell's Kitchen

Music, bad weed

And grass will change your musical habits, for the better
Bad weed right there

Quas, when he really hit star mode
Never will he boost loose Phillies with the bar-code
Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
Or sit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black & Mild
He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
The list top go: bust before beef start
At the Stop-n-Go Mart, actin' like a spirit host done it
""America's most blunted!""
Yeah, yo
DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
Some say buddha-ed, some say faded
Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (True)
Sometimes you might need to detox
It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beat-box
Off spite to your surprise
Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it

I spark the lah, but don't shh with speed or trees with seeds

The most blunted on the map
The one astro black, in the alley, with a hoodrat

Shut the **** up! Even your pops got smacked
Even your moms got cracked

But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject

And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then

For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet

Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

[Post-Chorus: Eve]
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh)

[Verse 2: Eve]
Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes
[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

[Verse 3: Eve]
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time

Ayo, dawg, I got some shit on my motherfuckin' chest
That I need to get off 'cause if I don't
I'ma fuckin' explode or somethin'
Now, look, this is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more, it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin' their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm tellin' you right now, motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see, he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin' cipherin' name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you were sayin' and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin' weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin' 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on, dawg, you was s'posed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared? And Fred, you said you was dissin' him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you
They don't hate you, they just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you!
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all some...
[Hook]
Girls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, hah)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Post-Hook]
Now, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
To be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them
I'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften, no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no, nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin' off me
I'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say, ""Fuck Christina!"",  he says, ""Fuck Christina!"", but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin'!
And fuck Bizkit! 'Cause I know you're sayin', ""Fuck D12!""
Only not to our face, under your breath to yourselves

Girls (Motherfuckin' females)
Why do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies, you pussies
Keep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know the truth)
How fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'!)
In fuckin' Bentley's and pretend to be down

You put your tail between your legs and bow down

[Outro]
And that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin' MTV talkin' about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now, I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up-shit when I see you
And I will see you, too

Okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical Roscoe, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana

Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
I'm admittin' I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial
Killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
Capable of winnin' a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur‚Äì
‚Äìprises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (High)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit

Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast...

The Point of No Return,rap,Immortal Technique,2003,214605,{},"[Intro]
Yeah, it's that real this time around
Immortal Technique, Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!

[Verse 1]
This is the point of no return, I can never go back
Life without parole, upstate, shackled and trapped
Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos
Rapin' the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle, pitchfork, and machete
The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusin' 'em, nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's Temple
Al-Aqsa, the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me
No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?
Genetic-engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back
[Chorus]
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore

[Verse 2]
This is the point of no return, nigga, you better believe this
Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians: criminal-minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga
'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone
So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?
It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie
[Chorus]
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore",2753,en,en,en

I bought a Cadillac and put them thangs on that bitch
The brains blowed out with the white leather seats
Fienders screaming for that butter cause that other shit is weak
I was only 17 had the neighborhood hooked
Had 'em stealing out they crib cause my crack taste like ribs
I'm up in the morning with the rest of these rookies
You out here selling them dimes, bitch I'm out here selling them cookies
I'm flying out of town getting them thangs for 12-5
400 for an ounce and 650 when it's dry
Pyrex dishes in the motherfucking kitchen
Word around town Mr. Bigg got them chickens
That nigga bought a house for his ma by the lake
And gave his grandma set of keys to the safe
Them jealous ass niggas and them hoes started hating
To see my lil' sister drive a Benz to graduation
I'm tripping on that Hennessey and I'm smoking on them buds
I still got love for them niggas selling them dubs
I remember when I use to do the same shit
Buy a half-ounce and cut it up and sold the block up
I can't put my Glock up; my Glock is my ho
And my ho go everywhere I go
Which one of you fake ass niggas wanna harm me?
I said you better bring the Navy cause I'm gonna bring the Army

They know about the Benz and the black Pathfinder
They know about the vacation trip I took to China
They know about the ho I was fucking named Cathy
Heard she got busted with a bird in Tallahassee
And now they tryin' to say that the yay belong to me
I know they trying to get me caught; these niggas keep holding they nuts on me
Dickie suits, and bullet proofs, and steel toes
No fake ass niggas only some real hoes
I pack my shit cause it's time for me to go
I'm getting tired of em kicking in my ma door
And even though they don't find shit they talk shit
Asking questions saying how the fuck you bought this shit
And how the fuck you don't work but drive different cars
We got you on the interstate in a Jaguar
Where that dope and them motherfucking guns at?
We'll let you go if you tell us where yo son at
Shit, I don't know nothing: light it up and type it up
And tell the D.A. get ready cause we gon' strike it up

See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly

I need insurance that you could sex me the best.""
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then ""ding ding,"" the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard

When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
See what happens when the ice age melt
You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
I rock a timepiece by Benny, if any
The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
A man's measured by the way that he thinks
Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
I spent twenty-plus years seeking knowledge of self
So, for now, Marc Predka's living live for wealth
(Krrr, Amadou!)

Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now

You can't see me, my time is now!

You can't see me, my time is now

Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on

This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

I don't know if all boy scouts are gays
They could probably ""tie the knot"" in like fifty different ways
Got a safe full o' cherries, 'cause I pop it and lock it
A girl's like a fridge, once a week you should stock it
Girl, if you're into rimmin', it's only safe if you're swimmin'
But girl, don't sit on that couch, 'cause I treat my objects like women
I spit fire like I just blew a demon
My shit's so hot I'll leave your toilet bowl steamin'
I'm gonna tear it, like the cards of the gypsies
You'll bleed for so long you'll get monthly ellipses
And if your pants are loose, I'll replete ya
You're a first time vegan and it's nice to meet ya

I'm Bo yo
I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G, shawty, that can really find your G-spot
Whoa, yeah
Hey...what the fuck's a G-spot?
[Verse 2]
Go to a vagina orchard, count 1, 2, 3
Spin that plant around, you got a third world country
That's right, consider yourself warned
I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn
You're playing with your breasts, excuse me, can I try it ma'am?
You're pushin' em together like a titty Venn diagram
Look at that crack! Excuse me can I buy a gram?
Right below your diaphragm, ass looks like you're hidin' ham
First base, we're makin' out
Second base, I'm gettin' faked out
I said, third base, I'm gettin' take out
And I'd try to take it home if I knew I'd take it out
But I just don't know, I said I just don't care
I said my flow's so cold I need a tampon from a polar bear
And you can spell and smell my stink
B.O. lingers and it makes you think

Because I skeet her so hard people call her Patty Mayonnaise

Yo, I'm blowin' up like I thought I would
I'm circumcised, 'cause I don't cum from the hood
My girl is epileptic 'cause she's the one I'm jerkin' with
Come on, you Asian child laborer, show me what you're workin' with... (ooh, large machinery?)

'Cause there's an inverse relationship between respect and sects
I'm talking about religious sects like a Mormon sect
That says you can't have sex with members of the different sects
But you can't have sex with members of the same sex
So if the sects can't be different, the sex can't be same
Then the only sex left is some left hand shame
And girl I left you 'cause you left the game

Play the skin flute, your big boy sings
If you want to take it all wear African neck rings

Careful What You Wish For,rap,Eminem,2009,212837,{},"[Intro]
""Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops""
""Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--""
""On again/off again relationship with...""
""This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus...""
""Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot""
""Shady/Aftermath recording artist...""
""Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12""
""D12, back in the news again today...""
""Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'""

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit
[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold",2331,en,en,en

I got a fetish for fuckin' you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon

But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent

I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen

Like when we kissin' - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight

Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
'Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
Baby, I can only help but wonder
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)
Ah-ah-ah
You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
It's a man's world, but I understand
But there's still nothin' different, boy, stick to the plan
You be my down ass, witcha round ass
I know I'm feelin you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin my body, the way you touch me

And fuck policing, they killing niggas, what's the reason?
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin', leavin' niggas stuck and bleedin' on the flo'
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that‚Äôs darker than the tints up on the windshield
Uh, welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield, high as a Sprint bill
What you think? That's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phony niggas until they are extinct, bitch I‚Äôve been real

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, hey, uh
And two times for you, yeah
And one time for the city, hey, hm
And two times for you, hey
[Verse 3]
Them old niggas sayin', ""Cole the wrong one bringin' the city shine
All he ever doin‚Äô is paintin' pictures of crime
Tellin' stories of pain, paintin' pictures of dope""
Bitch if you listenin', I'm paintin‚Äô pictures of hope, huh
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin‚Äô today he won‚Äôt be the butt of somebody‚Äôs joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin' my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein‚Äô the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin' the streets, hey ma, I‚Äôll be home soon
Was out chasin' hoes, was out hoopin'
Them niggas wasn't ballin' but yet they was foul shootin', uh
So meet the newest role model who don't know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look, I made it bitch

[Chorus]
Huh, and one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey

[Outro]
Girl it's been so long, I've been gone from you
But you ain't gotta worry 'bout the thangs I do
It's hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon' know our name, uh
Ain‚Äôt seen you smile in a while
But I been dreamin' 'bout you

Somebodys Gotta Die,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1997,211825,{},"[Verse 1]
Ah, ah!
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Lear jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how to sell records like Snoop (oops!)
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52 - who the hell is this?
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it!
I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful: ""Is he in critical?""
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit, Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie, my alibi: any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin' 'bout my man C-Rock

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Uhh, fillin' clips, he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
""Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew, 'round the time I was locked up with you""
""True indeed""
""But yo, nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, where was I? Yeah
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife (niggas is trife)
He figured Rock set 'em up, no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction"" (uhh)
""How many shots?""
""Man, nigga, I seen mad holes""
""What kinda gats?""
""Hitchlinks, Kochs, and Calicos""
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin'
And they don't be strapped
Supreme and Black is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if you're comin'

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know

Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go

Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throwdown
How it's gon' go down?
Lay these niggas low-down
""Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship!""
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the nigga they want and murder innocent kids
Not I
One nigga's in my eye, that's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
""Pass the chocolate, Thai!""
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case this nigga start squealin'
Scream his name out: (""Ay yo, playboy!"")

Yesterday,rap,Atmosphere,2008,211762,{},"[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop, ‚Äòcause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

[Chorus]
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‚Äòcause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‚Äòcause I miss you?
[Verse 2]
I'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of‚Ä¶

Or am I just going crazy ‚Äòcause I miss you?
[Verse 3]
And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you, ‚Äòcause you passed away, Dad

Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through

Lights, all of the lights

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this ""give-or-take"" world, I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time, I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh!
No lights but them infrared lights
Long knife, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go 'til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
""Westside bitch,"" quote, unquote
Whoa there, boy, don't go there, ho
If you cross that line, I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named ""Big"" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named ""Sean"" got money? Ooh
Well, I guess my chances are fifty-fifty
But my vision is 20/20, so I be counting a hundred hundreds
Like, oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took your chick, now you want beef, and I'm just chuckling like I'm Porky
'Cause you spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and they want these bullets to book it for me, man
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin' broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gon' book report me, what?
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard (Hard), 'cause, bitch, I'm an emergency
[Chorus: Rihanna & Choirs, Big Sean]
Turn up the lights in here, baby (B-I-G)
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this (I do it)
Turn up the lights in here, baby (Boi, boi, boi)
You know what I need (Yeah)
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights (You know a nigga so good)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys, Big Sean, Elton John]
Whoa, whoa (So good, Westside)
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh (I'm so hood, I do it)
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 3: Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made five-thousand look like fifty
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush, but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made two million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I ain't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some ""me time,"" it's our time, so fuck y'all
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas was going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV, it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
(Lights on) And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy, nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
(Lights on) And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
[Interlude: Kid Cudi, Drake, Rihanna & Fergie]
Gettin' mine, baby (Yeah)
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah (Shout out my nigga Cudi too, that's my motherfuckin' nigga for real, man)
Gettin' right, babe (Shout out Cole)
You should go and get ya own (Think we got a buzz now, nigga, fuck y'all niggas, man)
We're going all the way this time (I'm here)

We going all the way this time (All of the Lights, all of the lights)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (All of the lights!)

Turn up the lights in here, baby

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. in a 1996 MTV interview]
Gotta try to stay above water, y'know?
Just stay busy, stay working
Puff told me, like, the key to this joint
The key to staying on top of things
Is treat everything like it's your first project, nomsayin'?
Like it's your first day, like, back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Y'all wanna know why he don't stop?
Y'all wanna know why he don't flop?
Let me tell you pe-people why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit ‚Äì that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again
No prob' livin' was a whole lot simple
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far
Then you take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Ain't no half steppin', ain't no, no slippin'
Ain't no different from a block that's hittin'
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye! This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)

Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers, homeboy

Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon-roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like I'm facin' twenty years in the basement
Chillin' on a VI with Mumia, for wearin' chrome
I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone, I'm thrown, yo
[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that (Lyrical, ly-lyrical shine)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 3]
Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation we livin' in
Dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick housing
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin' thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TEC's you blessed, word
So, now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood
[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

07/03, re-noi j'ai re√ßu ta lettre du 25/02
Dehors toujours la m√™me merde, les stup' et les ragots √† r√¥der
Des gars de confiance me disent conna√Ætre la poucave
Un ancien pote avec qui on aurait rapp√©
Bref, on verra apr√®s, Mounir m'a appris
Que tu partageais la cellule avec son fr√®re, passe-lui la paix
Trahi par la raison quand elle manquait √† l'appel
Tromp√© par les juges qui de nos vies n'ont jamais rien compris
Tromp√© dans la prison et ses murs pour les ann√©es qu'elle vous a pris
Bern√© par la folie et sa pr√©sence, tout est √©crit
De la naissance et son cri jusqu'au linceul et son silence
Fr√©rot, mes mots suffiront pas √† scier tes barreaux
Mais √† renforcer ta patience, faut en faire de l'acier
Tour√© a de bonnes nouvelles, il se pourrait
Que Mala quitte Nanterre √† la fin du mois
Louanges √† celui qui fait avancer
Faut penser √† √©viter le mitard
Qu'on voie nos t√™tes √† la prochaine visite

Faut que je travaille pour que la pute me donne la condi'
Khami la s√®re-mi comme passer les f√™tes au tard-mi
Je gamberge et sans mon zoula, impossible de dormir
√âcoute Ali, √ßa va bient√¥t s'arranger, enfin je crois
Je tourne avec deux-trois gars du 9-3
Chez nos ennemis y'a plus de monde, ils m'envoient pas de mandat
Pourquoi j'√©cris des textes de ouf, ils se demandent
Au fait, para√Æt que l'industrie du disque a saign√©
Et que les n√©gros arr√™tent pas de signer
J'ai vu les autres au parloir, para√Æt que √ßa papote
Bien s√ªr toujours les m√™mes putes, √ßa sent la douille, ma couille
Maintenant je me tiens √† carreau, parce qu'au mitard √ßa sent la civi√®re
Et je r√™ve de baiser l'infirmi√®re, n√©gro
Je suis tomb√© si bas, que pour en parler faudrait que je me fasse mal au dos
Putain quelle rime de b√¢tard !
Bref, quand je sors, ram√®ne-moi une petite pute, b√™te, sans but
Je la ferai crier du bout de ma longue bite
Quand on va kick' √ßa va √™tre tragique, panique √† la clinique
Magique, c'est du 11'43 ma 'zique
Sinon dans ma cellule, je fais des pompes, j'√©cris des textes, je taffe
Et sur les murs j'ai des photos de 'tasses
Et le maton me guette, porte-clefs √† perp√©tuit√©
Si, si, leurs mamans sont des prostitu√©es

I Gave You Power,rap,Nas,1996,208151,{},"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet
Finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads
[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf wit' a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge
Sick of the blood, sick of them thugs
Sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

So take it while you got it, try to get a little more
They say I'm gettin' better than I ever been before
Well, that's for sure, tell 'em what I do

The Message,rap,Dr. Dre,1999,207171,"{""Mary J. Blige"",Rell}","[Intro: Dr. Dre]
This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen

[Post-Hook: Rell & Mary J. Blige]
If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on ""The Promo""
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back 'cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last
[Chorus: Trugoy the Dove]
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere
[Chorus: Trugoy the Dove]
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA

Something You Forgot,rap,Lil Wayne,2007,206649,{},"[Hook]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
That's all I can do mama
The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me

[Verse 1]
Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
'Cause, um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!
[Hook]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it, mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot

[Verse 2]
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap

[Hook]
You've been hiding (Y'know)
Never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin', it mama)
To keep it under control (But I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty
[Verse 3]
But I hope you haven't forgot about me‚Äî
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""butter,"" I called you ""babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

Yo, Mo Bee, mayn, drop that shit!
You know what time
Boo-yaow! I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?
And uh, throw up that finger!
Hey yo, throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style, baby, thug style, y'know?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me, baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's Hell see, I never thought I'd
See the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walking and you looking good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killing me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
'Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've been stressing in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand (Look here)
I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...

[Chorus: Easy Mo Bee]
I know you've been searching for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Getting weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people calling I'm passing by
Everybody knows I'm balling and to God
Gotta keep myself from falling, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Getting shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in Heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was..

A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'

Yo, yo, yo, yo, you know who this is, boy, for real
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?
R.I.P. B.I.G., nigga, R.I.P. P.A.C.¬†
R.I.P.‚ÄîEnough of that shit, it's time to O.D.¬†
Don't take this shit serious, we just bugging the fuck out
One time
But y'all can take it how y'all want it, word

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
The bottom line is: I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell, I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
Dance your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight? I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan, tell him, ""Tell your man""
Mason Betha, haha
Come up off that watch now, I mean, right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob O.D.B., but that'd be a waste of time (Yeah)
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold‚Äîlike four mil? He got something to live for (Uh-huh)
Don't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like ""Dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more, where you getting chips from now?""
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah, for real, son, I'm sick
I'm 'bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now, I'm bent, and when I get like this, I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight-ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece and run (Uh-huh)
This nigga weigh four hundred pounds‚Äîhow he gon' catch me, son? Huh?
[Chorus: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Word)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger

This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Uh-huh)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'll catch P and Silkk the Shocker right after the Grammys
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like, ""You, give me the cash; you, put the hotdog down""
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before (Uh-huh)
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D.? ""Fuck you, pay me!"" (Yeah)
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down? Well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave (Uh-huh)
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny-ass rings (What)
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroner's picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, ayy, nigga, I saw you
He said, ""Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for you!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all; he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
""One at a time, get out and take off your shine""
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens (Yeah)
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough‚ÄîI told him, ""Gimme some more""
If you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people, what!
[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Word)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga? (Tell 'em, son)
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Uh-huh)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Outro: The Madd Rapper]
Yo, yo, for real, son, it's The Madd Rapper, you know what I'm saying?
And for real, you know what I'm saying, niggas just got to get stuck up, yo‚Äîthat's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch
It really don't matter‚Äîif you got it and I need it, I want it

Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the buses

Young! It's the life
Once again it's the life, yes
I don't know why, I.. get so high oh
It's intoxicating, man, y'all don't know why you do what you do
Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man, my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""
[Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toup√©e, mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a souffl√©
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your two-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing
[Chorus:  JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course...
[Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Outro:  JAY-Z, Pharrell]
Once again its the life
Yeah I said its the life
Once I again its the life
(Oh no! I don't know why, I...)

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder

The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing

My gat talk for me, BOW! What up, homie?
Them bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me

I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The Ds run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracs
They keep 'em on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah!)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, and sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words, I make a blind man see (Woo!)

Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blat!)
Do it Cali style, drive by and tear your block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, ""Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em""

Be unsuccessful too, and even have friends.""

I got these niggas, Breezy, don't worry about it
Let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
'Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with

I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor
I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys
(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)
I got watches I ain't seen in months

Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in
Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much

Love You More,rap,Eminem,2004,202453,{},"[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?
We say we do it for our baby, but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck till we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
Till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad, but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause‚Äî
[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' ‚Äî yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus, I can bust in that, and that's why‚Äî
[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric in every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up no matter what
[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'mma hunt you down till I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

First entry for Sickology 101: Dysfunctional

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me, I wanna get dollars, don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way 'cause back in the day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might
Dude's tryin' to pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, 'cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish, surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded when exploded you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Women be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

If you fool around and make me mad

If you push me it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can‚Äôt get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push me, play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?

Could be carrying something up under my hoodie
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, 'cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine

Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy

Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money

20 years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant

In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying

Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow

Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me

See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an
Another one page-in, tellin' me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey

I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy

You'll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G, you can bag and scan me

Yo D, what? Come on, yeah
What? What? Come on, yeah

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & Both]
""Give me the fortune, keep the fame"" said my man Louis, I
Agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so, tomorrow comin' later than usual
Waitin' on someone to pity us
While we find the beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell
You know what I mean? ‚Äî Pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells
Dollar bills, or is it the mind-state that's ill?
Creatin' crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion, there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal, they be recitin' my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means bustin' gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son ‚Äî no vindication of manhood necessary
[Chorus: Mos Def, Talib Kweli & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Now, who the nicest?
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave?
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

[Verse 2: Mos Def & Both]
Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listenin' agree
That everythin' you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin' the style
Be a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America ‚Äî land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually
Speakin' loudly, sayin' nothin', you confusin' me, you losin' me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walkin' the street, wonderin' who they be lookin' past
Lookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song ‚Äî just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht, but they won't call it the slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control us, you barely hold this
Screamin' ""Brand new!"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been runnin' across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressin', there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illin' that be fillin' up the cemetery
This life is temporary, but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie ‚Äî let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free ‚Äî we only licensed, not live ‚Äî we just excitin'
'Cause the captors own the masters to what we writin'
Not compassionate, only polite ‚Äî we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasin' after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory
Like that, y'all
[Interlude: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
A lot of people don't understand the true criterion of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
They ain't lookin' around

[Chorus: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Now, who the nicest?
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life

Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name

That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath

Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons

Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah

How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how

I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye

But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Chorus]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream
[Verse 3]
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah

Bring Me Down,rap,Kanye West,2005,198413,{Brandy},"[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down
They'd try to bring me down

[Verse: Kanye West]
We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say?
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""He say, she say""
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo ingl√©s""
And everybody want to run to me for their sing-le
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something
[Bridge: Brandy]
What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down
They'd try to bring me down",3137,en,en,en

Sorry I'm late, I just got caught up watching the Pirates of the Caribbean marathon. Have you seen those things?
Oh, yeah, yeah, those are... those are great
Well, I checked out the track and I loved it. And I wrote you this big, sexy hook I think you're gonna really dig
Oh wow, that's great. You wanna just lay it down?

Three pound at my waist, shank in my sock (Oh)
You either get cut, get stuffed, or get shot

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
A pirate so brave on the seven seas (What?)
A mystical quest to the isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean breeze

Buying up the bar so the groupies show us love (Keira Knightley!)

But in Davy Jones' locker, what lies in store? (Yeah, we've seen the movie)
[Bridge: Andy, Jorma, & Michael Bolton]
Put your hands in the air and say ""Hell yeah,"" come on
Captain Jack! What? Johnny Depp! No

Coolest nigga, what? (Dumb it down!)
F-N-F, up! (Dumb it down!)
(Dumb it down!)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless
Which means I'm tearless, which means my iris
Resides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded
But I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness
But I'ma veer, so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace
[Hook 1: Gemini]
You going over niggas heads, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They telling me that they don't feel you (Dumb it down!)
We ain't graduate from school, nigga (Dumb it down!)
Them big words ain't cool, nigga (Dumb it down!)
Yeah I heard ""Mean and Vicious,"" nigga (Dumb it down!)
Make a song for the bitches, nigga! (Dumb it down!)
We don't care about the weather nigga (Dumb it down!)
You'll sell more records if you (Dumb it down!)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless
Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying
I feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, ""hot fiya"" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn
Sleep?
[Hook 2: Graham Burris]
You've been shedding too much light, Lu (Dumb it down!)
You're makin 'em wanna do right, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're gettin' self-esteem, Lu (Dumb it down!)
These girls are trying to be queens, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're startin' to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)
They're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)
I'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside!

High All the Time,rap,50 Cent,2003,198021,{},"[Produced by DJ Rad, Eminem & Sha Money XL]

[Intro]
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz√©, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla, ""Roll up!""
Then I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money
You ain't smoking in my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls, Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz√©, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Bridge]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that lye, lye-lye-lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit!""
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I could go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne
[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz√©, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me
Who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Aliz√©, I don't need shit

I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, ‚ÄúAin't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?‚Äù
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came, me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod

And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack

When homicide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money down now, yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, ""tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail""
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
Two Ace to the deuce, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull ups in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck
[Chorus]
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, that's when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

(Gun shots, police sirens and helicopters going off
While it thunders and rains)",7105,en,en,en
