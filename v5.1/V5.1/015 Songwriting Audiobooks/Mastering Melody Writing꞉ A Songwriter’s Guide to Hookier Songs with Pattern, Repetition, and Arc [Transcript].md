# Mastering Melody Writing꞉ A Songwriter’s Guide to Hookier Songs with Pattern, Repetition, and Arc [Transcript]

Mastering Melody Writing. A Songwriter's Guide to Hookier Songs with Pattern, Repetition, and Arc by Clay Mills and Bill O'Hanlon. Narrated by Ray Weaver.

Foreword. A great song takes you anywhere. When I was seven years old, I stood watching my uncle's band rehearse in a small farmhouse in the Mississippi Delta. salsa. This is my first memory of live music.

I would hang for hours watching them rehearse, soaking in the magic of guitar strings, drums, and harmony vocals. I was transported into a new, exciting world. From that first note, I wanted to create my own music.

I had no idea how to do it, nor did I have any idea that I would one day write songs for hit recording artists. That's the real power of a song. It took a wide-eyed kid out of small-town Mississippi into writing rooms and recording studios all around the world.

Song power lit the ideas in my head and heart until they found their way to multi-platinum records, radio airwaves, and stadium stages. You see, songs don't care whether you're rich or broke.

They don't care if you were born into the music business either. Great songs travel, and great melodies get sung or hummed despite language barriers circling the globe in a world all their own.

At 19, I officially started my musical journey with a grand total of $300 in my pocket, a friend who offered me a sofa for a month in New York City, and a desire to follow my crazy dreams.

Today I am fortunate enough to be a multi-platinum songwriter and producer having penned number one hits for Darius Rucker, Don't Think I Don't Think About It, Diamond Rio, Beautiful Mess, and Kimberly Locke, Fall.

Along the way I've collected Grammy nominations for Beautiful Mess and Tricia Yearwood's Heaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love. Hundreds of my songs have been recorded by major artists spanning the genres of pop, dance, rock, country, bluegrass, and gospel.

A few artists who have recorded my songs include Lady A, Babyface, Little Big Town, Reba McEntire, Easton Corbin, Clay Walker, Andy Griggs, and many others. Some of my favorite hits include Darius Rucker's History in the Making and I Got Nothing.

I tell you all of this for two reasons. First, I believe great songs open doors. And secondly, I believe it's important when you are learning anything about making music or songwriting that you look to people who have a track record of accomplishments and success.

I believe we, as teachers of songwriting, should earn the right to show you a way forward if you're interested. Moreover, it's important not only to find mentors who walk the walk, but who are equally adept at explaining the steps they take in their daily journey.

In addition to working as a professional songwriter for many decades, I have a passion for teaching passed down to me from my parents who spent their lives as educators and authors.

I've taught and mentored thousands of aspiring songwriters over the past eight years through Songtown, an online community I co-founded in 2012. So I spent a lot of time thinking about what I do.

The elements laid out in this book are not only proven to work in the real world, but also have helped many of my students achieve big results in their songwriting journeys.

Right on. Clay Mills About my co-author. Bill O'Hanlon is an aspiring professional songwriter. Bill has written or co-written 38 previous books, so we've decided to join forces to write this book.

Bill's book publishing credits include Do One Thing Different, which landed him in the chair across from Oprah, The Songwriter's Guide to Mastering Co-Writing, co-written with me and my Songtown co-founder, hit Nashville songwriter Marty Dodson, and Songbuilding, co-written with Marty Dodson. Bill brings writing and publishing expertise as he plays the role of student learner for you, the reader, making sure everything is clear for the beginner, intermediate, or advanced songwriter.

Introduction Discovering the PRA Method In my Melody Masterclasses, I teach melody to songwriters by coaching them how to make their melodies more memorable While explaining the what and how of writing hooky and timeless melodies, I created the PRA method to conjure the intangible of melody making into graspable parts.

Three key elements for writing memorable songs and melodies are encapsulated in the PRA method. Pattern, repetition, and arc. Because each part builds upon the other, much like a beautiful melody, I think it's best to learn the PRA method in this order. In Chapter 1, we look at melodic patterns. I like to think of it this way. A song's melody consists of a series of melody notes arranged in rhythmic patterns. In the Patterns section, you will learn to recognize patterns, write more memorable patterns, understand melody, rhythm, chords, and rhymes.

In Chapter 2, we look at Repetition. Repetition is the art of repeating melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic patterns in a memorable way. A successful song uses repeated patterns to engage the listener and leave a lasting impression.

In this section, you'll learn to create symmetry between melody, chords, and rhythm. Compose variant repeating patterns of melody, chords, and rhythm.

Recognize hotspots. And finally, in Chapter 3, we look at arc. The arc of a song is the rise and fall of the melodic story. I believe successful song melodies tell stories both separately and in conjunction with the lyrics of the song.

Melody tells a story through emotion and sound rather than words. In this section, you will learn to arrange repeated patterns into a memorable song arc, Build an emotional story from beginning to end, and recognize the role of each song section.

Just as we are riveted by a well-told story, we should get hooked by well-told, well-written melodies. In Mastering Melody Writing, I will demonstrate how to tell a good song story using the three elements of the PRA method.

Inspired vs. Reactive Listening Inspired listening is a personal songwriting habit I developed in the early days of my own creative journey and a method I recommend to every aspiring songwriter.

Inspired listening to songs means noticing what we like about a particular song and then analyzing which elements inspire or hook us. We can file these elements away and recall them later.

The goal is to channel them into our own music. Inspired listening gives us the opportunity to grow. Reactive listening to songs is opinion-based and serves little purpose other than reinforcing what we already think we know about music.

It often involves making negative and dismissive assessments. Too many times I have heard bitter or frustrated aspiring songwriters say, I could write a better song than those I hear on the radio.

Or, every song on the radio sounds the same. Or, I hate today's hip-hop or country or opera or classical or bluegrass. Reactive listening rarely helps a songwriter improve. Songs are ultimately a conversation between the writer, singer and audience, so part of becoming an accomplished songwriter is understanding your listeners. What do they find interesting about songs in a particular style?

How are they emotionally connecting? Perhaps it's the cool way the vocal plays off the guitar riff, or the way the song begins with the chorus instead of the verse, or maybe it's simply a beautiful series of notes.

Spend some time being curious about what makes a popular song appeal to the listener's ear, so much so that it got recorded and played over and over. Train yourself to listen with an inspired, appreciative, open attitude.

Remember, the goal of inspired listening is to discover methods and techniques that you can find a way to incorporate into your own yet-to-be-written songs. I recommend searching for inspiration in every song you hear and then spending some time thinking, what about this element appeals to me?

I am always listening for tools I can add to my own songwriting toolbox. Deliberately seek out genres of music you would never listen to and again, find something about each song in that genre that works or makes it hooky and compelling.

Try putting yourself into that audience's seat. I make it a regular practice to set aside time each week to just listen to new music. I encourage you to do the same. Soak in a variety of styles, sounds, and genres.

Listening to music you came of age to is okay, but those Those songs are already embedded into your DNA, so it's especially beneficial to get outside your comfort zone.

Inspired listening is the first step in a series of techniques included in mastering melody writing to soak the ideas and methodology into your bones so your melodic storytelling comes alive.

The Songwriter as Corporation U I once heard writer and musician John Mayer say each songwriter is like a corporation. Every time the songwriter learns some new method or skill or picks up a trick from someone else's writing, playing or singing, it's akin to a corporation acquiring the assets of another company.

You can file it away and pull out the technique when it fits a future song. Oh I love how the melody went down in pitch for the chorus section. It really has a chill vibe.

I'm going to try that in my next song. In mastering melody writing, yes, I'm giving you the tools I've used successfully. But not only do I want to help you incorporate the PRA elements into your songwriting corporation, I hope to teach you how to recognize and acquire new ones for your own melodies.

You'll soon be listening to songs and melodies differently in discovering your own distinctions, tools, and methods.

Turning anything into a melody. The Talk-Sing Method

Once early in my songwriting career, I was driving to a co-writing session with Hall of Fame songwriter Rory Burke. Traffic was extremely slow that day. I rushed into the writing room and frantically said, I'm so sorry that I'm late.

Immediately, Rory sang what I had just said. I'm so sorry that I'm late. I chuckled, but when he continued to repeat little things that I said throughout the co-writing session and at lunch that day, I got a little annoyed.

However, over the next few weeks, I found myself doing the same thing in everyday life. I'd hear an actor say something in a movie and immediately, without thinking, sing back the phrase.

A friend would say something in conversation and I'd repeat it back with a melody. It was as if I had caught a melody disease. Over time, I started to notice it was easier and easier to conjure new melodies while songwriting.

Singing what I or somebody else was saying was teaching me how to turn phrases into melodies melodies in a seamless way, in an instinctual way. I was shortening the distance between lyrical thought and the melody of a song, striking closer to the emotion of the words.

Oh, and by the way, some of those phrases that Rory sang back to me turned into great songs. I still do this exercise to this day. I owe Rory a big thanks for teaching me this valuable technique.

I encourage you to use this technique with phrases you hear on TV, on the radio, or in everyday situations. This will help train you to intuitively fit phrases into melody and rhythm.

No thinking or filtering. Just sing. For this melody muscle builder, remember there is no wrong way to sing a line. It's all about shortening the lag time between thinking words and breathing musical emotion into them.

So sing away! Mastering Melody Writing includes an interactive resource website. Throughout this book, I will be referring to numerous musical examples that illustrate techniques you will be learning. Rather than have you chase down all the songs yourself, I've put together a resource website as a companion to this book. You'll find all the song examples I mention organized by chapters.

I've also included some bonus lesson videos for you as well. Simply go to [www.songtownpress.com](http://www.songtownpress.com) and click on Mastering Melody Writing to access your resources. I recommend keeping a blank notebook dedicated to mastering melody writing for your inspired listening and for the put-into-practice exercises within this book.

Creating your own companion workbook gives you an invaluable reference moving forward until these practices become second nature.

Glossary I've included a short glossary at the back this book of some terms, concepts, and methods I've developed over years of teaching. Also, you'll find some inside lingo in the glossary that is used in pro-writing rooms around the world.

Okay, now let's get started learning the PRA method so you can write better melodies. Part

1 Creating Compelling and Memorable Songs

Chapter 1 Patterns Section 1 Musical Patterns in Songwriting I've had a lifelong love affair with songwriting and searching for timeless song devices, a quest to understand what makes great songs tick and stick from classical to jazz to rock to rap. Patterns are one of the core foundational devices that successful songs stand upon to create memorable melodies. The brain loves patterns and gets hooked on them. Patterns help us make sense out of chaos.

A short ride through the Disney theme park attraction, It's a Small World, proves it and very possibly might haunt you for days. So be warned if you've never heard this catchy tune.

This basic appeal of pattern repetition is one of the melody writer's most powerful tools for drawing in and hooking listeners. These three main musical elements get patterned in songs.

Melody, notes, rhythm, chords,

melody patterns.

Melody patterns consist of a series of repeated notes that catch the listener's ear. Any sequence of repeated notes is a pattern. If the melodic sequence is executed only once and never repeated, the song becomes less interesting, less compelling, and less memorable.

To create melody patterns, the songwriter can play with the sequence of notes, intervals between the notes, the length of notes, and rhythm in which the notes are sung.

Some notes are stretched out while other notes end quickly. As the songwriter, you might experiment placing space or rests between notes to compose patterns. By combining lyrics with melodies, we have a few more variables to play with.

Rhymes, vowel and consonant sounds, and line lengths. In popular music, we typically have 12 available notes or tones to use in our songs. You'd think after thousands of years of songwriting, we would have created all the possible melody combinations. But clearly, we haven't. Newer songwriters can fall into the trap of hanging on to the first melodic pattern that comes to mind. However, this is not often the best possible melody for the song.

Another rookie mistake is to use a hooky melody once and then never repeat it in the chorus or in a verse. Mastering melody writing gives you a lot of options for developing your initial melody and then rewriting techniques to make it better.

Developing your melody muscles can make the difference between having a song that is just okay and a song that is memorable with a wide commercial appeal.

Rhythmic patterns. Rhythm is the second element to pattern in songs. Most likely, this is the first way we wrote songs in human history. We clapped, tapped, and stomped to create repeating rhythmic patterns.

Rhythm is a foundational element of melody. One way to look at rhythm is to talk about beats in music. The beat of the music is the way the notes are stressed. By clapping four times in a row, with each clap spaced evenly and at the same loudness, a songwriter introduces a rhythmic pattern. By clapping twice and allowing some space between the next two claps, a different rhythmic pattern or beat emerges, and so on. Combining sounds and silences makes up a song's rhythm signature.

The silence between sounds is called a rest, while tempo is the speed at which the notes or the rhythms are played in the song. When notes or tones are added to the rhythms, the foundation of a melody develops.

An infinite number of ways exist to pattern the rhythmic elements of a melody. You can vary the beat on which you start the melody. You can start on the first beat, the second, and so on, or even in between beats.

For example, if we count out the bar one and two and three and four and the melody can start on the and of one any note can be emphasized on any of the beats putting the emphasis on the upbeats the ands where it is unexpected is called syncopation example one and two and three and four some balance is required between repeating and varying rhythmic patterns within a song.

If we incorporate too few rhythmic repetitions, the listener either won't be drawn in or the song won't be memorable. Too much pattern variation? The song gets confusing or overwhelming.

And this concludes your Mini Music Theory lesson. In Section 2, we'll examine a powerful rhythmic pattern that when combined with melodic and lyric repetition makes a song almost irresistible.

I call it the Line Plus technique. But first,

chord patterns.

Most songs have a series of chords that repeat and catch the listener's ear, making chords the third element pattern in songs. Mastering melody writing focuses primarily on melody, but since melodies exist within chords, some discussion is necessary.

Before the lyrics of a song begin, chords generally are played as a purely instrumental introduction to the song. The chords and groove, the rhythmic feel, establish a mood. Then, throughout the main body of the song, they continue supporting the vocal melody. Three and Four Chord Songs The most common patterns, progressions, in popular songs include only three or four chords.

If you search YouTube or the reference website for this book, you'll find a fun video called the Axis of Awesome, which is a mash-up of songs using the same four chord patterns.

This video illustrates two things clearly. An amazing variety of songs can be written from an identical chord pattern. Many popular songs use only four chords, so even if you're not guitar god or keyboard wizard, you can write a catchy song.

If you use the same four chords throughout your song, The challenge is ensuring that each section of the song has a different melody and a different rhythm to that melody.

We'll talk about contrasting sections in the chapter on ARC. But for now, know that many great songs rely more on melodic and rhythmic variation than copious chord changes when writing a compelling song.

Keep in mind, even though the four-chord pattern is used quite a bit, there are other chord repetition patterns that are effective in melody writing. Like four-chord songs, three-chord songs are also fairly common.

Bruno Mars' hit song, Just the Way You Are, takes a three-chord approach. The same three-chord pattern appears in both the verses and the chorus. However, as I mentioned above, the song changes the rhythm and flow of the melody to contrast the verses and the choruses.

In fact, the entire genre of country music is often described as three chords and the truth. Blues and early rock and roll, too, are based on three chords over a 12-bar phrase.

One chord songs. If utilizing three or four chords on an instrument is daunting, know that a good number of hit songs have been written using only one chord. Check these out. Pink, Get This Party Started, Bob Marley, Get Up, Stand Up, Blake Shelton, Neon Light, Aretha Franklin, Chain of Fools, Beck, Loser, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Run Through the Jungle, Steely Dan, Showbiz Kids, Harry Nielsen, Coconut, Eddie Grant, Electric Avenue, you.

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley and I'm a Man, both sides of Bo's first single, are one chord songs. Listen to the examples on [www.songtownpress.com](http://www.songtownpress.com) to discover how effectively the songwriters use melodies and rhythms in these songs.

Notice how they've incorporated both tension and release in the melodies without the aid of resolving chord progressions. Listen to Aretha to sing the chorus lyric to Chain of Fools.

Her voice stretches the third word chain out longer, starting a half step under the eventual note in pitch and slowly bending up to the correct notes. This slow bending action builds tension in the song, even though the chords never change.

Blake Shelton uses the same technique on his song Neon Light. He sings the word light, bending up to the note from a lower pitch, creating beautiful tension, and then release.

As you listen to these one-chord songs, observe how the contrasting melodies and rhythms between verses and choruses keep your interest. Many songs based around one chord employ a repeated instrumental pattern called a riff or motif to make the song more memorable.

The repeated pattern is often played on a bass, guitar, or keyboard and gives the feeling of harmonic movement even though it's based around a single chord. As you dig deeper into the playlist, you'll notice that most one chord songs are mid to uptempo.

They have a groove. They have energy. Finally, remember that chords are a powerful tool for establishing the basic mood of a song. They paint with a wide brush of emotion and make the listener feel happy, sad, joyful, or melancholy.

I suggest experimenting with different chord patterns under a melody rather than settling for the first pattern that comes to mind. Pay attention to how different chord progressions make you feel.

Do the chords match the mood of the lyric? Experimenting freely will lead to more control over chord choices while developing chordal instincts. Section two, the line plus technique, uncovering a secret melody pattern for hookier songs.

I co-lead an online songwriting community called Songtown. In the course of mentoring these aspiring songwriters from around the world, I've had the opportunity to listen to and critique thousands of songs.

In the attempt to help up and coming songwriters make their songs better, one day I discovered a timeless device I call the line plus technique. Once I explained the pattern to songwriters and gave them a few examples, the songs they were writing began to sound more commercial and engaging. The end result leveled up what they were writing before learning and experimenting with the line plus technique. After hearing this idea, Even professional songwriters have found it influences and improves their writing.

They may have used line plus intuitively in the past, but now they have a tool they can use more consciously and deliberately to bring their songs to a new level. I truly believe if you grasp and use this concept, your songs can be better. One hit songwriter recently dropped in on my workshop and he told me this story. As a lyricist, he had written the words to many hits, but his publisher never liked any of the melodies he'd written.

So as a result, he co-wrote with great melody writers and had a lot of success. One day, he saw a video of me explaining my line plus technique and decided to try it. He wrote both the melody and lyrics to a new song and sent it to his publisher.

Everyone at his publishing company loved the song. He didn't mention to his publisher that he employed the Line Plus technique. He winked at me and said, it was our little secret.

I called the Line Plus a secret, but it's actually been in use for hundreds of years. The secret is, I figured out how to teach this way of making songs hookier and patterns more accessible to the songwriter.

Section 3 What is Line Plus Technique? Discovering Line Plus Technique I remember it clearly. It was just an ordinary day and the beat changed everything. I was in my recording studio watching a video of a friend talk about a drum beat called the Tresillo, which came out of Africa and found its way to the Caribbean islands.

The Tresillo is often used in drum patterns in modern music. The word Tresillo comes from the Spanish word meaning triplet or three equal notes in the span of two beats. I started thinking about a song I'd heard on the radio, featuring a guitar strum vamping on the same pattern. It hit me that maybe singers use this in song melodies. All at once, songs that use the torsillo beat in the vocal melody began flooding my mind.

However, I also noticed other songs using different patterns of three, not just the torsillo. ago. The constant in the songs is a three-note pattern at the end of a melodic line.

I scribbled on the notepad, line plus three. Over the next few days, I recognized it in classical music, dance, jazz, and country. It's everywhere. Then I started envisioning variations, line plus two, three plus line, two plus line plus three.

I was energized and more creative than ever. It was as if a door of understanding opened to a whole new way of approaching my melody writing. I had used line plus three in songs occasionally.

Some of these songs got recorded by big artists. Some became hits, but I never understood what I was doing. It was all pure instinct. By putting a name to it, I realized I had only scratched the surface of what this technique could bring to my songwriting.

Once I opened this door and understood what I was hearing, the technique led me down completely new musical pathways in my melody and lyric writing. Let me explain the principles I have discovered, developed, and incorporated into my own writing to create more memorable and lasting melodies.

What is the line plus three technique? Most people think of melody as a series of notes or pitches, but as a songwriting mentor and coach, I think of melody in terms of rhythmic patterns as well. Line plus three is a song pattern that uses rhythm, rhyme, and melodic repetition to make songs better. It can make them more memorable and compelling to the ear. This is often called hook ear in songwriter lingo.

The reason it's called hook ear is because the human ear and brain gets caught by certain patterns and repetitions like a fish biting down on a hook. If you can hook your listener on the first listen, you're more likely to write a successful song.

I've called this technique line plus three because this is the most common form I hear in songs. Here in mastering melody writing, it might also be called line plus or plus line because there are multiple variations that involve repetitions of two or four beats or notes instead of three. In addition, this technique can be used at the beginning of a line, rather than at the end. Line plus three is not just a modern pattern. Listen to the finale from Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, the one with the cannons, if that helps you remember it.

If you still don't know how this music goes, find it on songtownpress.com and listen, please. Do you see it and hear it? Three beats clumped together at the end of the line and repeated, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, one, two, three.

Even when it changes notes, it repeats the same rhythmic patterns. The Beatles song, Yesterday, the most covered song of all time, has a number of these three note rhyming sections. Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday.

One of the best examples of line plus three from the disco era is Never Gonna Give You Up with Rick Astley singing. It uses the classic tresillo or triplet feel at the end of its chorus vocal lines.

And yes, you are about to be Rick rolled. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye.

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. I like to think of these types of melody patterns as two separate parts, the line followed by the three. Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, or never gonna one, two, three, never gonna one, two, three.

This triplet one, two, three pattern is not only prominent in melody, but often is played with musical instruments on songs. Listen to the mallet percussion sound in Ed Sheeran's Shape of You, you'll hear this three-note feel clearly.

This is the Tresillo beat that led me to line plus three. Really, listen. I'm serious. Stop listening to me right now. Go find these pieces of music and listen to them until you can identify the three-note sections in each of them. It will make the concepts in the rest of this book so much easier to understand.

The Rule of Three In storytelling, there is a principle called the Rule of Three. This principle points to the tendency for plays, movies, and stories to have three repeating or related elements.

Stories and plays usually have three acts. In fairy tales, the hero is often granted three wishes. images. In the story The Three Little Pigs, the big bad wolf visits three different pig houses.

We tend to receive and retain stories better when there is a beginning, middle, and end. The power of three goes well beyond storytelling. There is the biblical Holy Trinity or the three-sided pyramids of Egypt.

There is something about groupings of three that appeals to the human mind. And so, too, there is something about the power of three that hooks the ear in music. Making Line Plus Three Even More Hooky The most hooky version of Line Plus Three uses three.

There it is again, that rule of three, repeating elements, melody, rhythm, and rhyme. Think again of that memorable section in the finale of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.

You know, the one with the cannons. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, one, two, three. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, one, two, three. Each line ends with three distinct and strong notes.

Those final three notes are slower and more deliberate. Almost as if separated from the rest of the melody line that comes before. more. If we insert some silly lyrics to sing with the three-note phrase, we might have da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, can't you see?

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, it is three. Or we could have these equally silly lyrics. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, I love you. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, it's the truth.

The point is, the most hooky thing a songwriter can do is repeat the three-note melody, the three-note rhythm, and add the lyrical three-syllable rhyme or near rhyme. The brain grabs onto that quickly.

When the pattern is repeated several times, we're ready to sing along and remember that signature part of the song. Once you become aware of this pattern, I predict you'll start hearing it all over the place.

A warning. Enough is enough. If you take the time to listen to the songs mentioned, you'll notice there's something crucial about how they use line plus three. The songwriters use it in two or three lines. Then they don't use it in the next line or two. Sometimes Sometimes they use line plus three again after not using it for several lines. The ear gets fatigued when hearing the same repeating pattern too often.

Likewise, you might notice that the songwriter uses either line plus three in the verse or the chorus, rarely in both places. So be careful not to overuse line plus three.

Think of it like a little piece of spice to enhance the appeal of your songwriting dish. However, if overused, you'll spoil the whole song. A tip, choose descriptive words.

The lyrics in the plus three section are more memorable than other lyrics in the song. So make sure to choose important words. Don't waste your opportunity on words like and and the in these key positions. Here's one way to ensure you use the plus-three pattern with the right words. Look through your lyrics and underline important or descriptive words that convey the emotion or meaning.

Then, if it works melodically and structurally, put the plus-three pattern with those words. Or try rearranging lyric lines to place the descriptive words in the plus-three section. Good examples of line plus three from hit songs. NF songs Let You Down consists of several line plus three lines in a row. This grabs your ear from the first listen. Here are the rhyming words at the end of each line in which the triplet rhythm repeats. Edge right now. Say I'm proud. Let you down. Let you down. Head get loud. Shut them out. Let you down. Let you down.

Post Malone's Better Now starts immediately with a number of line plus three lines and draws us in, or better labeled line plus three plus three, as he repeats the three at the end of each line.

Da da da da da da, better now, better now. Da da da da da da, not around, not around. Let you down, let you down. Eric Church nails line plus three in the course of his round here buzz round here buzz round here none down goes up one stop light welcome sign round here buzz devin dawson's country pop hit song all on me uses line three for a hooky chorus and also employs the technique of rhyming the first word of the plus three section call and of fall out, count, high, and time.

In addition, he ends each line with repeated words, on me, for added hookiness. Call on me, fall on me, out on me, count on me, high on me, time on me. Even slow ballads in 6'8 Time benefit from line plus three.

Check out the chorus of Ed Sheeran's perfect, fell in love, what it was, give you up, kiss me slow, all I own, eyes you're holding. And for a final example of the power of three, here are some of the song titles from Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA album.

Half the songs on this iconic album employ three syllable titles. Cover Me, Downbound Train, Bobby Jean, Glory Days, My Hometown, even the title song Born in the USA has the three-syllable USA at the end.

Line plus three wins. Born in the one, two, three. Springsteen clearly has an intuitive feel for using the power of three in his songs, and his success speaks for itself.

So using the plus three pattern at the end of a lyrical and melodic line is probably the most common way, but not the only way way to use the line plus technique. Section four variations on line plus.

Sometimes the three beat repetition occurs at the beginning of the line rather than at the end. I call this three plus line. It works exactly the same as line plus three, but in reverse.

Thomas Rhett's country pop hit song unforgettable uses this three-plus line pattern in the chorus. He starts every chorus line with a repeating three-note three-beat phrase.

He doesn't rhyme these since he uses rhyming at the end of the line. That mango Rita you were drinking that Coldplay song that you were singing and I bet right now you're probably thinking.

Note, the writers get extra bonus points for using colorful descriptive words in the three section. Mango Rita and Coldplay are mucho descriptive words. Placing them over the plus three section makes the song tray hooky.

Thomas Rhett uses this three plus line pattern again, but this time it lands in the verse of his hit song, Craving You. Every time, say goodbye, every touch, strongest drug.

Rhett appears to like this pattern because another of his hit songs, Life Changes, also uses the three plus line pattern. In this one, the chorus three plus line pattern doesn't even change the words.

He just repeats the phrase life changes with the same rhythm and melody. Here's an example from a hit song I co-wrote with Darius Rucker, History in the Making, which uses the three plus line pattern in the chorus.

This could be memories, baby this, last first kiss.

Maren Morris's I Could Use A Love Song uses 3 plus line. Long gone dry. Don't know why. I could cite many other examples, but you got the point by now. You can use the 3 plus pattern at the beginning or the end of a melodic line.

Line plus 2 and 2 plus line. This technique is a little less common, but still shows up often as two rhyming syllables at the beginning or end of a line. Little Big Town's country song of the year, Girl Crush, uses this line plus two pattern.

Girl crush, heart rush, real bad, she has, no peace, bed sheets. Dan and Shay's country pop hit Speechless uses several two-syllable near rhymes on the same melody to grab listeners.

Speechless, that dress, secret, weakness, nervous, pro tip, big bonus points on Dan and Shay's hit. The writers tell an interesting story using only the plus two section.

Speechless. That dress. Secret. Weakness. Nervous. We get a good sense of what this song is about without even reading the complete lyric. The Beatles' song, Wait, has some memorable line-plus-two lyrics and melodies.

Long time, now I'm, way now, oh how. Dustin Lynch's country hit, Good Girl, uses line-plus-two in the title and other lines. Good girl, whole world.

One-plus line. While much rarer, some songs use a one-plus pattern. Take a listen to Dua Lipa's New Rules to hear a good example of one-plus line. She uses one-syllable words starting the chorus with the word one and then starting subsequent chorus lines with two and three to hook the listener. Of course, there are other variations, line plus four and four plus line, line plus five and five plus line, but again, I think you get the point. The important thing is that you start hearing melody, not only as a series of notes, but also as hooky rhythmic patterns.

Section five, how to learn line plus naturally. Here are a few ideas and exercises to practice and master the technique. Raise your awareness through inspired listening. Go back and listen to the introduction. Three simple actions can quickly ratchet up your awareness. Listen for the line plus pattern in songs, on the radio, or in TV shows and movies.

Make a Spotify or Apple Music playlist of Line Plus songs for deeper analysis. Listen for the placement of the Line Plus pattern in each of those songs. As you listen, continuously ask yourself questions such as, which variation of Line Plus does the songwriter use? Is it at the beginning of the line? The middle? The end? pattern? Is it in the verse or the chorus? Does the writer also include repeating rhymes? How many of the line plus occur before the writer moves on and establishes a different rhythmic pattern?

How many lines of that new pattern do I hear before the song returns to the line plus pattern? Learn to play and sing line plus three songs. Absorb line plus into your body.

Another good way to learn Line Plus is to learn to play and sing hit songs with these patterns. Melody is a mental, emotional, and physical experience. Performing music can help you master the nuances of how other songwriters use the Line Plus 3 technique by absorbing the pattern into your body.

Memorizing melodies from other people's songs will help speed up the process of creating your own hooky melodies. Great guitarists spend many hours learning new songs from their guitar heroes.

Likewise, memorizing great songs will help build and expand your musical vocabulary. I say you should focus on the hit songs because these songs have proven catchy and therefore have used the line plus pattern in a good way. Tapping into line plus. Our songwriting brains often get stuck in our usual patterns. One way to change these patterns is to drop out the melody chords and lyrics and simply tap out a rhythm to which you can write. Try tapping out a rhythm and end with a pause and then three clustered taps. Do this a few times until you have that pattern down. You may have to record it and listen to the rhythm again and again to get out of your old grooves.

Now, try adding some melody notes to the rhythm you tapped out. When you're happy with the melody, try adding a few three-word or three-syllable phrases to the melody. Now, try the same thing, but place the plus three at the beginning of the line.

Try out the variations I mentioned. Line plus two, two plus line, line plus four, four plus line. Lastly, write a few lines and melodies to each of these. You don't have to write an entire song.

Simply use these exercises to start mastering the line plus pattern.

Rewriting with line plus. Try taking one of your existing songs and rewriting it with line plus. Find one of your songs that you think could be improved or made more hooky.

If the song has lyrics that have three syllables, even better. Rewrite a few of the lines using the line plus or plus line pattern or any of the variations. If you need to, tap out the new rhythm as I've already described and use it as a guide.

Try co-writing with someone who gets line plus. When my co-author Bill first learned the line plus pattern from me, he found it difficult to incorporate into his songwriting, but he often co-wrote with songwriters who were better at using this pattern intuitively.

Writing with them helped Bill get a feel for using the line plus pattern in his writing. get started in the co-writing room. Bring in three-syllable titles as your contribution in the co-writing room.

Also, think of lyrics that use three syllables. You can suggest using line plus to a co-writer who is not aware of the pattern. Hey, give them mastering melody writing or suggest they get a copy.

Just as I suggested before, learning to play and or sing the songs, you co-write with people who are more skilled at using line plus will help you get the pattern in your bones.

Line plus summary Once I recognized this pattern and named it, I shared the line plus technique with the songwriters in my song town master classes. They got excited and started writing better songs. One of my student writers remarked, I can't believe I never noticed this before. Even my wife, who is not a musician, can pick it out as we listen to the radio. We play a game now to see who can call out the patterns first.

It's been rewarding to witness many of these students landing staff writer deals at major publishing companies, getting songs recorded by major artists, and hearing their songs on the radio. In my own songwriting, I've started using it more consciously than ever before. Remember though, mastering melody writing is not just about providing specific tools for writing more compelling melodies, it's also about raising your awareness of hooky patterns and discovering additional patterns to add to your toolbox for future songwriting. You might just revisit past songs with your new techniques, too. And of course, pattern is only one of the elements used in writing great melodies. In the next section, we'll take a look at repetition.

Chapter 1 Recap Patterns Music patterns consist of three main elements. Melody or notes, rhythm and chords. Well-written patterns hook the listener.

Melody must incorporate tension and release to keep the audience listening, especially when working with only a few chords. Line plus is a powerful system of melodic pattern writing that makes songs more memorable.

The most popular variation of line plus is line plus three, but many other effective variations exist.

1. Repetition Creating interesting melodic patterns is only the first step in making your melodies memorable. Next, you must find creative ways and places to repeat these patterns.

Many times, when critiquing songs, I will spot a great melodic pattern established by the writer. Often, it will be at the beginning of their chorus. My ears perk up and then I am let down.

Why? Because nowhere in the chorus is that awesome pattern repeated. I am promised a great hooky chorus and it never materializes. A big part of learning to write memorable songs is spotting when you've created a great hook and then to repeat it. When and how to repeat a great hook is something fine-tuned with practice. Well-written songs soak into our brains by creating ear candy and hooks that make us eager to hear the song again and again.

A major way to create ear candy is by selectively repeating some melodic patterns. Of course, there's a fine balance when it comes to repetition. Too little and the listener doesn't have much to grab onto.

Too much and the song becomes boring, especially after several listens. But the human brain loves repetition. Songwriters and performers love it when they see and hear the audience singing parts of the song after a few listens. I remember the first time I stood off stage and watched Darius Rucker perform our song Don't Think I Don't Think About It to a live audience. By the second chorus, the entire audience was singing along to the repeated words, Don't think I don't. Don't think I don't think about it. Don't think I don't have regrets. Don't think it don't get to me, between the work and the hurt and the whiskey. Don't think I don't wonder about, could have been, should have been, all worked out.

I know how I felt, I know what I said, but don't think I don't think about it." Even though the audience hadn't memorized all of the words yet, they could sing along to the chorus and repeat the words, Don't Think I Don't, five times.

The real trifecta is how we married the words Don't Think I Don't to the same melody notes and rhythm pattern each time they repeated. And to keep it interesting, we used the end of the lyric lines to tell the story.

From the crowd's reaction, we knew we had a hit on our hands. Darius wrote the song all the way to the top of the Billboard charts for his first number one single. Repeated melodies sometimes outshine rhyming in a successful song.

Listen to one of Paul Simon's early songs, America. You may not notice it has almost no end rhymes. The closest he comes Syllables are raincoat, ago, and why, turnpike, on only four of the song's twenty-two lines.

These elements of the song can be repeated to hook the listener and make it more memorable. Rhythms, melodies, chords and chord patterns, words and phrases, number of syllables and repeated emphasis on syllables, riffs, which are instrumental patterns, production elements, vowel sounds and rhymes, consonants, also called alliteration.

Today, many melodies are influenced by hip-hop and rap, which often uses rhythmic hooks. When my co-author Bill first started pitching his songs, he heard time and time again that the songs were fine, that the melodies were dated.

Even though the production was modern, the song sounded dated because there were few, if any, rhythmic repetitions. After participating in one of my melody masterclasses, Bill started listening to more recent hit songs and paid particular attention to the rhythmic repetition and hooks I had highlighted in my class.

Soon, by using the inspired listening technique, he was hearing and incorporating new rhythmic patterns into his songwriting. He told me he no longer hears the comment that his songs are not contemporary.

So let's start with rhythmic repetition. Rhythmic repetition. A rhythmic pattern is defined as the placement of sounds in time, an ordered alternation of contrasting beats. It is a strong, regular, repeated pattern of sound. When you repeat rhythmic patterns in sections of your song, you hook the listener, their brains will begin to anticipate this pattern after it repeats a few times.

Rhythmic repetition has a formal name in music, ostinato, which derives from the Italian word for obstinate, but we'll just call it by its street name of rhythmic repetition here. Rhythm can exist without melody, as in simply clapping your hands or playing the drums, but melody cannot exist without rhythm. Therefore, songs cannot exist without rhythm.

So learning to create hooky rhythmic patterns and repeating them in interesting ways, you will significantly improve the quality of your songs. Listen to the chorus of Stayin' Alive sung by the Bee Gees. Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive. Clap along to the rhythm of these chorus lyrics as they play. Now turn off the music and clap the rhythm without the melody notes.

This is a basic rhythm pattern. Train your ear to hear rhythm patterns separately from the melody notes. If you're a drummer or have a strong sense of rhythm, this won't be a challenge.

But using your inspired listening technique and becoming acutely aware of what makes certain patterns hooky in great songs will make your own writing stronger. Inspired listening will also help you develop a sixth sense for intuiting how often to repeat patterns.

The Bee Gees knew their rhythmic pattern was hooky. They added melody notes and lyrics and then repeated perfectly throughout the song choruses. This attention to rhythm helped them write one of the most definitive disco songs.

Let's put it into practice. Listen to the rhythmic pattern in the chorus of Stayin' Alive. Rewrite the melody notes to the pattern but keep the same rhythm intact. If you play an instrument, try adding different chords and grooves beneath it as you sing your new melody.

Replace the words ah-ha-ha-ha staying alive with your own new lyric line. I mean, who cares if it's silly? This is an experiment to build skills. Make this a regular exercise in your writing life. Learning to write new melodies and chords to a set rhythm pattern will help you master two big things. How to hear rhythm and melody as two separate entities, and how to use repeated rhythmic patterns as a springboard into creating your own hooky songs.

Pro tip, you can also keep the listener's ear by repeating a pattern and then introducing a variation on that pattern. An extra beat or note, a stretched out version of the repeated pattern or a shortened version.

Be careful not to repeat this same rhythm throughout the entire song or even entire sections because you may lose the listener and render the song boring. Writing to drum loops.

Track people and top lining.

A lot of modern songwriting is a collaboration between track people and top liners. A track person, a beat maker, often creates a music track or groove before the songwriting session and uses it to jumpstart songwriting ideas in the co-writing room.

These track creators are treasured by songwriters because hearing a cool new groove can spark inspiration immediately. Track people also tend to approach songs from a rhythmic or beat sensibility, and hooky melody rhythms often come more easily when writing to tracks.

There are also apps that generate rhythmic patterns and drum loops. Use these to discover rhythmic patterns that inspire you to write. Modern recording software programs called Digital Audio Workstations or DAWs have built-in drummers, loops, or drum patterns that songwriters used for rhythmic patterns and inspiring songs.

In fact, my first number one song, Beautiful Mess, sung by Diamond Rio, was written to a drum loop. I was hanging out in the writing room with Shane Miner and Sonny Lemaire.

We started talking about our mutual love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I pushed a button to play a loop on my computer and rap these lines, going out of my mind these days, like I'm walking around in a haze, in the pepper style of rapping." We all fell out laughing.

And then it hit us. This sounded pretty cool. We had the inspiration to begin a new song. In Beautiful Mess, the first two lines are identical both rhythmically and melodically, establishing a repeated pattern for our verse. We added a melody instead of rapping the words. When we finished the song, we demoed it in a more country style with a seven-piece live band. And we had our first number one hit as a songwriting team.

If creating drum beats and recording music is not your thing, don't fret. You're probably more suited to be a topliner. Topliners work with the track person adding melody and lyrics on top of the musical track. In modern co-writes, there can be more than one top-liner on a song. In my songwriting session for Beautiful Mess, all of us were top-liners because we top-lined over a drum loop on my computer.

Often in a co-write, one top-liner or writer creates the melody and the other writes the lyrics, or each does a little of both. In these scenarios, everyone is vital to the song in a different way.

The musical track, lyrics and melody are all written by a team of track people and topliners. One of the big perks to writing this way is you can have a finished or nearly finished demo of your song by the end of the writing session.

Put it into practice. Ask songwriter or musical friends for recommendations or search your app store for drum or rhythm creating apps to make your first beat or groove.

Listen to your groove for a while and then write a melody that fits. Try playing off of the drum hits with your melody patterns. Pro tip, be careful not to let the beat take over. It's there to support the melody. So always make sure your melody is hooky with or without the beat beneath it. It's easy to get enamored with a cool sounding beat and fail to assess if your melody patterns are interesting.

Repeated Melodies Obviously, some melody patterns should repeat in your song because the human brain seeks out the familiar. You have about 3 minutes to repeat some parts of your melodies so the brain recognizes something familiar in the new song.

Interestingly enough, there seems to be a limit as to how many times you can repeat the same pattern without the brain wanting to hear something slightly new, such as an extra bar of music added to what is familiar or a new pattern. I have noticed that in many hit songs the repeated melody pattern happens only two or three times before a new pattern or element is introduced. What makes acid jazz or atonal classical music so hard for most people to relate to is the lack of repetition.

An advanced listener can find patterns in these genres, but most casual listeners just want to hear something simple that repeats and grabs them. Nursery songs, hymns, and national folk songs often have simple repeating melodies.

Think Mary Had a Little Lamb, Happy Birthday, or Amazing Grace. When you are writing a song, try to find that sweet spot between atonal classical or jazz and simple nursery songs.

Let's look at the course of a song that crossed genres to become a number one hit in both pop and country. Body Like a Back Road, sung by Sam Hunt, has a simple yet extremely hooky melody.

Body Like a Back Road establishes a set melody pattern. Driving with my eyes closed repeats the melody pattern. I know every curve like the back of my hand. Variation. It starts the same, but it veers off.

Doing 15 in a 30. Back to the original pattern. I ain't in no hurry. Repeats the original pattern. I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can. Variation. It mimics line 3.

Some parts of your melody can be simple at the same time as other parts are more complex. Some repeat and some introduce new elements. The balance between the familiar earlier and the new is crucial.

Put it into practice.

Listen to a few of your own songs and ask these questions. Is there too little repetition so that you need to find a few melodic rhythmic phrases to repeat? Is there too much repetition so you need to introduce some new melodic elements?

Is there a cool melody sequence that you only do one time. Try repeating it. Repeated Notes Have you ever played Neil Diamond's song Sweet Caroline at a party? As soon as you get to the part in the chorus that goes, Sweet Caroline, a bunch of people in the crowd will inevitably sing, Baa Baa Baa in response. Those repeated trumpet notes, ba-ba-ba, are memorable, and they make good use of the power of three. Sometimes it's a series of notes, sometimes it's just one or two. Try the party song thing with the Beatles, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, and many people will join in on the first word and note of the chorus with hey every time it comes around. 3. Repeated chords Sometimes you can use repeated chords to make your songs more compelling. This way the chords become part of the melodic hook. Leonard Skinner's Sweet Home Alabama is a classic tune.

You recognize this song as soon as you hear its three opening chords. Outkast, Hey Ya, Wild Thing by the Trogs, What I Like Think About You by the Romantics and Closer by the Chainsmokers all use prominent repeating chord patterns throughout.

Tom Petty specialized in this way by using repeating chords in Learning to Fly, Won't Back Down, Free Fallen, and others. Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit has an iconic set of four repeating chords that both start the song and run through it. these chords embed the song in the listener's head and made Nirvana and Kurt Cobain famous. They repeat throughout the song with only a few deviations. This is an approach used by many popular song.

Pro tip, when using a single chord pattern throughout your song, it's important to use deeply contrasting melodies and rhythms between the different sections of your song. You won't have the benefit of contrasting chord patterns between sections so the other musical elements carry the responsibility of keeping the listener's interest. The worst thing you can do in this case is have a verse melody and a chorus melody that feel or sound similar.

Repeated words While more rare, some songs use the same word or phrase over and over, but vary the melody to make it catchy. The David Bowie John Lennon song Fame is a nice example of this.

Check out all of the different ways they repeat the word fame throughout the song. More examples include Million Reasons by Lady Gaga and the Skip James Blues song I'm Glad covered by Cream and later on Eric Clapton.

It might be that the song simply repeats the same phrase with the same melody and rhythm to hook the listener. The Red Hot Chili Peppers did this successfully with their song Give It Away. I did this in my co-written song Fall, which was a hit in both Country for Clay Walker and Adult Contemporary for Kimberly Locke. We wanted to create a hook with the word fall by sprinkling it throughout the chorus, using it a different way each time.

Fall. Go on and fall apart. Fall into these arms. I'll catch you every time you fall. Go on and lose it all. Every doubt, every fear, every worry, every tear. I'm right here.

Baby, fall.

Repeated Riffs and Production Elements Remember how the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction starts out? There's a unique fuzz guitar riff at the beginning that, once you hear it lodges into your brain.

My brain translates that guitar riff into two plus three plus line that dad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad. See, it's the same with the Beatles paperback writer. George Harrison plays a guitar riff you recognize instantly after hearing it the first time. Aerosmith's Walk This Way has an infectious riff that immediately pulls you in and recurs throughout the song. It is so hooky that Run DMC took it to number one years later with a rap rock version. Prince was an expert at creating these hooky riffs. Listen to his song Delirious for some synth ear candy that carries on past the intro and pervades throughout the song.

Sam Hunt wrote Body Like a Back Road with several other writers. One of the co-writers was Zach Crowell, who started in the music business creating hooky beats he could sell online.

He brought that sensibility into his co-writing when he moved to Nashville and became a track guy. Listen again to their song. Pay attention to the keyboard riff that begins the song and recurs regularly throughout. pop. This is one of the elements that kept the song at number one on the country charts for months and helped it become a crossover hit on pop radio as well. Sometimes these riffs are added by the band or studio musicians when the song is recorded, but they can become an integral part of the songwriting process.

On my song Beautiful Mess, my co-writer Sonny La Mer created a hooky guitar riff in the intro. When Diamond Rio went into the studio to record the song, they recognized it was an important element of the song and they kept this hook in their final version.

Who knows? We think it might not have made it to number one without all of these artistic ingredients, including Sonny's riff. If you come up with a cool riff to introduce a song or drop into a crucial spot in the intro, post-chorus, underneath the verses, or at the end, producers and studio musicians are apt to copy the original riff and leave it in.

Riffs are great attitude setters. They can be low-key and chill or they can be full of swagger. Either way, they should always make a statement. The best repeated instrumental riffs are pure ear candy and make your song instantly recognizable from the start.

And writing a melody and playing over a hooky guitar riff can be tons of fun. Repeated Consonants Alliteration consists of repeated consonants at the beginning of words in close succession.

Stephen Stills famously wrote these lines in his sweet Judy Blue Eyes. Lacey lilting lady, losing love lamenting. What, the L? That's a lot of L's in that lyric. However, it catches your ear, doesn't it?

Joni Mitchell memorably wrote and sang, They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. The Beatles, let it be, has this alliterative line, Whisper words of wisdom, pure ear candy.

These are almost melodic lyrics on their own because they use the repeated sounds of consonants. You can also choose similar consonant sounds that are not in the beginning of the words to bring more musicality to your lyrics.

For example, I hope you understand we're both going to have to bend. The N-D sound ties these two lyrics together in a subtle musical way. Put it into practice. As an experiment, rewrite this line several times using alliteration.

There was a time, not long ago, our innocent hearts ran wild.

Note the more you practice this, the more second nature it becomes,

repeated vowel sounds and internal rhymes. rhymes. You can also enhance the musicality of your lyrics by repeating vowel sounds. Construct your lyrics to repeat inner rhymes within lines, pre-choruses, verses, choruses, and bridges.

This is different from rhyming at the end of lines. Internal rhymes occur in the middle of lines. These words might rhyme with other words in the line or the word at the end of the line. from Miley Cyrus' hit Wrecking Ball, You put me high up in the sky. And it slowly turned, you let us burn. Here's an example from one of Bill's recent songs called Yeah, No.

I can't recall anything at all. They say they're on their way. We'll pick you up at eight. Notice how the first line in this pre-chorus has an internal rhyme with the words recall and all, and the second line uses the repeated internal rhymes of say, way, and ate, a near rhyme that still employs a long a rhyme. The ends of the lines don't rhyme in this song section, but the ear hears these internal rhymes and gets hooked. Bill and his co-writer use the internal rhyme method again in the first few lines of the chorus.

Yeah, no, don't want to go there again. Yeah, no. Already know how this one ends. Here the internal rhymes are no, go, and no. Unless you're writing rap or hip-hop, be careful not to overload the listener's ear with too many internal rhymes. However, a few well-placed ones can be good ear candy and hook the listener even on first listen. Sometimes, you can even skip the rhyme at the end of the line and simply use internal rhymes, as in the song Home, a hit for country artist Dierks Bentley.

He co-wrote the song with Dan Wilson and Brett Beavers. Scars, yeah, she's got her scars. Sometimes it starts to worry me. Cause lose, I don't want to lose sight of who we are.

There are no end rhymes in that verse, but several internal rhymes or near rhymes. Scars, starts, lose, who, and times, sight. That must have been enough to grab the listeners since it played regularly on radio, climbing the charts to top 20 and certified gold.

Put it into practice. Go through a few of your songs one at a time. Listen for the hookiest or catchiest melody rhythm pattern in each tune. Did you repeat it or did you do it just once?

Perhaps it's the first line of your verse. If so, try repeating the same pattern in the second line. Or skip the second and do it in the third line. Remember it's a grand experiment.

Try repeating the pattern twice in the same line. The more you play around with it, the faster you will fine-tune your repetition instincts. Pro tip, when working on a new song, it is helpful to record yourself during the session on your phone or another recording device.

If you do something hooky, you can stop and listen back. If it sounds good, try repeating it. Eventually, you won't need the recorder. You'll be able to spot great hooks in real time and repeat them as needed.

Hot spots. Songs have what I call hot spots. These are places in a melody that naturally draw in the listener like a moth to a flame. Hot spots can be utilized to add extra hookiness and emotion to songs by infusing the lyrics with rhythmic repetitions, rhyme repetitions, and melody pattern repetitions.

End of a phrase, rhythm, or rhyme. Yesterday All my troubles seem so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday. The first hot spot here is created naturally at the end of each line.

It's the last thing your brain hears in a lyric line before moving on to the next thought or line. So, learning to create something interesting at the end of lines gives your song a hooky advantage.

In the example lyric above, yesterday, Lennon and McCartney finished each line with the plus three technique. This adds an additional hook at the end of each line. That's an even hotter hotspot.

The second hotspot is the most common, the rhyme spot. Every time a word rhymes with another, it pulls our attention toward the song. That is why more and more songs not only rhyme at the end of lines, but also contain internal rhymes in each line.

For example, girl, you're only as lonely as you want to be. This creates internal melody hotspots on all three of the rhyme positions. If I write a melody to that lyric line, I would mentally circle the rhyming words and write a melody that perhaps uses the same melody notes on the first two rhyming words, only and lonely. I might even go a step further since both words have two syllables and employ the same rhythm on only and lonely. You can see a video example at [www.songtownpress.com](http://www.songtownpress.com) illustrating this technique.

High notes. When the singer hits a high note in the song it's a powerful hot spot. High notes always stand out in melody patterns and add both emotion and hookiness. That's why so many choruses contain the highest notes of the entire song.

If you want to write a strong hook with hot spots, try combining the high notes in a melody line with rhyme. A great example of this technique is the song Must Be Doing Something Right sung by Billy Currington.

One of the most memorable lyrical lines of the song is found in the chorus. Deep blue need you eyes. The writers illuminate this lines internal rhymes with their melody.

The words deep and need are placed as the two highest notes of the pattern and the words blue and you are on the low end of the melody. The listener hears this pattern as pure gold. The E sounds go up and the OO sounds go down. Check out this song sung by Tim McGraw, Just to See You Smile. The opening five words of the chorus establish a five-note melody pattern.

It's made more hooky by placing the internal rhyming words to and you as the highest note in the pattern. Every time the singer hits that high note, it rhymes. If the writer had written the same melody but changed the words to just to see that smile, it would not have been as hooky.

Sing it in your head and see what I mean. The internal rhyme paired with the melodic hotspot of the high notes takes this to the next level and makes it more memorable.

Next up, Important Words. Words carry most of the core meanings and messages of the song. By placing important words in melodic hotspots, you give them even more power.

In these places, I like to put both repeating notes and different notes. For emphasis, I go up or down from the rest of the melody. I sometimes add syncopation to the important words, or I add these words to the three section of a line plus three. The plus three will make the important words stand out, thus maximizing their impact. Earlier we looked at the Beatles' song Yesterday. They used the technique of line plus three.

The plus three is the melodic hotspot, so this is where they put rhymes and important words. If you read the important words, they almost tell a story on their own. Add the words troubles and now to the first stanza and it makes sense with only five words.

This is an excellent example of important words in melodic hotspots and probably one of the main reasons it's the most recorded song in the history of music. Yesterday.

Troubles. Far away. Now they're here to stay.

Title Hotspots. The First and Last Lines. The opening and closing lines of choruses often contain the title of a song. Why? Because the listener tends to remember the very beginning an end of a course.

First impressions and lasting impressions. These two hotspots are so important that many modern songwriters put their titles in both places. Some choose to showcase their title only at the end.

Historically in jazz and country, the title would often lie on the first or last line of a verse. Of course, there are many creative ways to vary from these norms, such as sprinkling the title throughout a verse.

However, the one inescapable rule is that your listener will key into the first and last lines of your song sections. So, even if your title is not in one of these places, make these melody and lyric lines count.

By studying title hotspots while practicing daily inspired listening, your instincts will develop quickly in this area.

Put it into practice. Go through your existing lyrics and circle hotspot words. Then experiment with those parts of the song adding distinctive melodic patterns to the words, phrases, or lines.

Check to see if there are internal rhymes in your lyric that allow you to use the same melody pattern on the rhyming words. Can you incorporate a line plus section where your important words fall?

Try putting into practice the techniques we've covered in this chapter. The goal is to create memorable melodic hotspots in the same places as your important lyrics. If you find it too hard to change an existing song, work through this same process with a new song before you lock into a final melody. Bill has one hotspot trick he likes to do to punch up his song's title. He breaks up the rhythm of how he sings the title by putting rests or beats in between the words of the title.

This, of course, only works for multi-word titles. For example, if the title is Break My Heart, when he gets to it in the chorus, he'll sing it like this. Break. My. Heart.

It emphasizes the words much in the same way as a text message written like this. Break. My. Heart.

Repeated Interval Jumps Interval jumps can improve a melody by making it more catchy. An interval jump is when a melody takes a bigger leap than usual between two notes.

Much of the time, melodies may walk up by half steps or whole tones, but sometimes they jump several or more than several notes. Think of the classic standard somewhere over the rainbow.

The first two notes are a nice example of an interval jump in the melody. The word some starts on a note, and then the next note and word where jump up a whole octave. If you want a fun dive into interval jumps, check out the band Maroon 5.

They write these brilliantly into many of their tunes. Listen to their song One More Night. At the beginning of each verse line, they sing the word you, then do an interval jump up on the second word and and then return to the original note on the word I.

Repeating this interval jump throughout the verse is super catchy. Combine this with the repetition of the lyric you and I on every line and you have a super hooky verse.

Notice how each of the first four lines of the lyric are the same number of syllables? This creates It's additional hookiness with another type of pattern, symmetrical lines.

Pro tip. When I discover a new technique or tool, I've learned it's vitally important to immediately put it into action and incorporate it into a song. When I first became more aware of interval jumps, I had the chance to do just that. I was asked to co-write with a new artist who had just signed with Warner Music in Nashville. The label felt our styles meshed well, so they asked me to write with Ryan Griffin for his upcoming album project.

After a few initial writing sessions, the songs we had written weren't exciting the young artist at all. So I decided to take a different approach. I asked him what he was listening to.

What music was he digging? He said he was really into the latest Maroon 5 album. him. Instantly I knew what I had to do. I knew from my own inspired listening sessions that the lead singer Adam Levine often utilized interval jumps when writing melodies for his band. So I started singing a verse melody that employed some wide interval jumps. I love that, Ryan said. By the end of the writing session, we had a song that truly fired him up and one he felt would really showcase his heart and vocals.

Because I was aware of the tools Maroon 5 used and had incorporated them into my own toolbox I could speak the same musical language as an artist I was working with. Once we got on the same page, a cool song followed.

Pro tip, interval jumps are often useful following a series of repeated patterns. Just when the listener settles into a repeated hook, adding in this device offers variety and keeps your audience engaged.

It's a balancing tool between the familiar and new.

The E.T. Mubi theme combines interval jumps with this next technique, which I call shape shifting.

Shape shifting. Shapeshifting takes a melodic pattern and repeats it with different scale notes. To do this, take a melodic shape and move the entire shape higher or lower on the scale.

The relationship between the notes usually stays the same, but the repeated pattern starts on a different note, perhaps a few notes lower or higher than the first pattern. One of the most well-known melodic phrases in music is the opening phrase of Beethoven's 5th symphony. It uses a rhythmic pattern of three short notes and one long note.

Bop, bop, bop, bum. And then repeats that pattern starting on different notes throughout the piece with some variations on the pattern and different instruments playing that pattern called a motif in musical lingo.

As you can hear in Beethoven's piece, The pattern doesn't have to repeat exactly, it can be close with a slight variation. One of the best examples of shape shifting lies in the Ronnie Millsap classic, Almost Like a Song, written by Archie Jordan.

Every line of the verse uses the same shape but moves down in pitch. Listen to the song and follow along with the lines. Once, in every life, establishes the five-note shape.

Someone comes along. Entire shape shifts down in pitch. And you came to me. Shape shifts down in pitch again. It was almost like a song. Shape shifts down in pitch again.

I had the pleasure of chatting with Archie Jordan over dinner early in my songwriting career. I told him I thought that song had a beautiful melody. He thanked me and said, you know, that melody is actually a piano exercise that every young piano student memorizes when they pick up the instrument.

Then he lifted his fingers in the air and played air piano as he sang the notes. A light bulb went off in my head. He took a simple melody that incorporated shapeshifting but added a beautiful chord progression along with it.

The chords almost disguise the melody while adding emotion to the simple note pattern. Another excellent example of shapeshifting is on the chorus melody of What I Really Meant to Say sung by Cindy Thompson.

Listen how the first three lines use the same shape to gradually move up the scale. Listening on, you will notice the next three lines of the chorus work their way back down the scale using a second unique shape.

One shape climbs up for the first half of the chorus, another shape descends down for the second half of the chorus. Very hooky and memorable. I've created some audio samples with simple shapes to listen to on the Mastering Melody Writing website. Make sure you listen before doing the upcoming exercise. Because now it's time for you to try out this shape-shifting method. Put it into practice. Write a short melodic pattern of a few notes.

Sing or play the pattern aloud, then move up or down in the register, retaining the initial melodic shape. Repeat and create as many shapes as you need to master this tool.

Newbie Tip Even if you don't play the piano, picking out the notes on a piano keyboard will help you see the shapes more clearly. If you are a newbie at writing melodies, don't worry, these techniques will get easier over time. It's important that we plant the seed now so you become aware of the techniques. Over time, your subconscious will grasp it, and everything will click. Case Example of Repetition Don't think, I don't think about it.

The chorus of my hit song, Don't Think, I Don't Think About It, recorded by my co-writer Darius Rucker, is a good example of using repeated melodies, words, and rhythms while at the same time creating a memorable hook. The song started with the talk-sing method. Remember that from the introduction? Darius and I were talking about breakups and old loves. He mentioned a grade school crush and that he still thought about her. I was surprised. Really, I asked. Don't think I don't, he shot back. Because I had trained myself in the talk-sing method, I immediately sang that line with a melody. Don't think I don't think about it.

We were off to the races. When you listen to the course of that song, you will hear the same five note melody and rhythm every time we repeat the words, don't think I don't.

We vary the ends of the lines to keep it interesting, but that basic five note pattern is the hook. The words, melody and rhythm all work together to build a strong hook. And by changing the chord under each five note repetition, we sustain the interest of the listener. Don't think I don't think about it, don't think I don't have regrets, don't think it don't get to me, between the work and the hurt and the whiskey, don't think I don't wonder about, could have been, should have been, all worked out.

I know how I felt and I know what I said, but don't think I don't think about it. We went beyond the initial spark of an idea to craft a song that helped establish Darius as a country artist.

He would go on to sell millions more records in this genre.

In this chapter, I've given you some of the elements for crafting a compelling and engaging song melody. There is no formula. It's more a learned skill and intuitive art than science.

Next we'll consider the whole song melody and how melody flows and contrasts from section to section and what I call the arc of the song.

Chapter two recap repetition.

Repetition is the art of repeating melodic harmonic and rhythmic patterns in a creative way. Hotspots are the naturally occurring consequence of a melody that draws the listener in like a moth to the flame.

Writing to drum loops and top lining can propel your creativity in new directions. Interval jumps are attention grabbers that add extra hookiness to a melody. Shapeshifting is a repeated melodic pattern that moves up or down the scale. Its strength is its ability to add variety without losing the familiar.

Chapter 3 Arc Melodic Storytelling and Song Arcs The human brain seeks out both the familiar and the new. In songwriting, we understand this when we combine new elements with things that repeat.

This both draws in listeners and keeps them interested. The stories in movies and novels have an arc. An arc is the trajectory of the story from where it begins to where it ends.

Quite simply, it is the journey. A good story takes us on an emotional ride with ups and downs, contrasts between moments or sections, and offers up a theme or motif that pervades the story.

It has both intense moments and less intense moments. It has both tension and release of tension. If a thriller is intense the entire way through, our adrenaline supplies might get depleted so that we end up not responding much when the really thrilling part of the story comes.

And have you noticed that most comedies have serious moments too? Writers build variations into their stories to support the arc. A melody Melody has an arc too. If an entire song remains at the same intensity level, the listener would likely be bored or turned off. That's why songs have louder parts, softer parts, higher notes, lower notes, and even silence. They have short phrases and long phrases, stretched out melodies and fast-paced melodies, longer line lengths and shorter line lengths.

A melody wants to take us on a journey. me. Sometimes it's joyful, sometimes sad, and sometimes it calls us to pump our fists or jump up and dance. When the song is over, we should know it's over because the arc finds its way to the ground or silence again.

I have heard songwriters playing their songs live and when they finish playing the song, it just fades out. When this happens, it takes moment for the crowd to realize the song is over.

Commercially produced songs rarely suffer from this problem but we can create arcs in our melody writing without relying on a studio produced track to make the arc obvious.

In many songs courses go up in melodic pitch and intensity. This is the section of the song where the singer hits the exciting high notes. Remember those hot spots we talked about in the repetition chapter?

Listen to Tim McGraw sing on his song of the year, Live Like You Were Dying. It's a classic example of a verse-chorus-bridge song arc. His note choices in the verses are lower in pitch, followed by choruses that soar higher.

And while the bridge starts low, it steadily builds until the final chorus explodes with emotion. The melody Melody arc and the production of the instruments work in perfect tandem.

Example, Live Like You Were Dying verse chorus bridge melody arc. Make sure you have a listen. Now some songs start out with the chorus first, such as In High Hopes by Panic At The Disco.

This format often works well for dance or high energy songs because they start right from the onset with the emotional high of the chorus. Make sure you listen to this example, High Hopes, Chorus First Melody Art.

As you can see, High Hopes gets adventurous melodically with two completely different bridges, but it holds true to that classic technique of hitting the highest notes in the chorus.

Notice how the singer saves the lowest notes of the melody for the first pre-chorus. This allows the maximum emotional impact when the following chorus kicks in. The point is that the melody should take us on a journey and have a structure that engages us emotionally and sonically. There should be a dynamic to the songwriting and production that provides ups and downs for the listener. Something that offers both the familiar and the new. So, now that you understand what a melodic story arc is, let's break down some of the key elements that will help you design an effective one.

Repeating Song Sections The first task of the melody writer and songwriter is to provide enough repetition so that the listener begins to recognize familiar note patterns and repetitions within sections.

But, learning the ins and outs of repeating entire sections is equally as important to the development of your song's arc. I have heard songs that have immensely interesting melodies, but there's no repeated chorus to sing along to, or perhaps each section of the song is different and never quite returns to any memorable place.

It might sound cool, but this can leave the listener confused and lost. Worse, they might not know which emotion they should be feeling. Songs are a conversation between the audience and the singer. We want the audience to know what the singer is feeling. We want them feeling it too. Repetition of song sections is one of the key tools a songwriter has to give the listener emotional cues.

The Chorus The chorus is where the title of the song is most often found. Lyrically it's the place where the big idea of the song lives. Think about At any concert you've ever attended, each time the singer sings that big hooky chorus melody, the lighters come out and thousands sing along.

They're all feeling the same thing in that moment. That's powerful. It is helped along by the repeated chorus section. There's a phrase that pro writers often use, don't bore us, get to the chorus.

That illustrates just how important a repeated chorus is. In fact, many second song verses are half as long as the first just so they can get back to the chorus more quickly.

When writing a chorus, it's all about balance. It's important to make sure the chorus melody supports that big lyrical idea and is hooky enough for your audience to sing along.

Remember that the chorus music and lyrics will be repeated over and over and over and over and over and over throughout the song. So, your melody should be interesting enough to keep the listener's attention and simple enough that it's memorable.

This is not always easy to accomplish, but with a little practice using the techniques in this book, you can find the right balance to move the listener emotionally. Most of us are very familiar with the concept of repeating a chorus section throughout a song.

It's also effective to repeat other whole sections of a song. 2nd Verses Traditionally, the 2nd verse of a song usually returns to the same melody established for the 1st verse.

Lyrically well-written songs tend to go deeper into the story for the 2nd verse. So it's useful to return to the established verse melody as a foundation of familiarity.

Perhaps the 2nd verse notes are embellished a bit, but they are rooted in the same bass melody. This gives the listener another hooky ledge to hold on to and remember your song.

The second verse is the new bridge. Composing a completely new second verse melody in a song, which does not follow the first verse melody, is a trend in mainstream pop music.

This technique was born out of records having features, meaning a singer or band features another guest artist on their record. The main artist sings the lion's share of a song, but the featured artist enters in at some point to rap or sing a new melody unrelated to any other section of the record.

As a result, many listeners have come to expect this variation, so much so that some solo artists write their own feature into a song, thus singing a totally different melody in the second verse. It's almost as if this type of second verse acts as the new bridge. Note, the traditional second verse is removed with this technique. If you experiment with this, remember that you will need enough hooks in the second verse to compensate for losing the repeated melodic symmetry between verses.

It's a good idea to keep that new verse short so that the song returns quickly to a familiar chorus. It is wise to learn to write traditional second verses before graduating into rule-breaking.

Mastering melody means having control and command over your skills. This level of skill will allow you to pick and choose which techniques are best for a song. Pro tip, more and more songs are hitting the top of the charts with extremely hooky verses. They almost feel chorus-like. The bar is set pretty high in today's music to keep the hook factor going throughout your song. So, work on your verses to make them as memorable as possible.

Don't wait until the chorus to throw your hooks in. Sprinkle them throughout.

Pre-choruses Many classic songs have employed a device called the pre-chorus. It's the section between your verse and chorus. Musically it serves as a ramp up from the verse melody to the chorus.

It's a real tension builder that propels the listener forward into the chorus. It also gives the songwriter more musical real estate to add additional lyrics and tell the story.

Pre-choruses are often melodically the same in both verses but include a different lyric in the second verse. With my second hit single with Darius Rucker, History in the Making, we came up with a short, single-line pre-chorus.

Baby, I've got a feelin'. Lyrically, we didn't need more than a single line, so we let that guide the melody. While writing the second verse, Darius thought the prior pre-chorus was exceptionally hooky. So, along with our co-writer Frank Rogers, we decided not only to repeat the same melody, but also to repeat the lyric as well. Since it was a single line, it felt hooky. If it had been four lines, the song would have screamed for new lyrics. Pre-choruses are fun sections of a song because there's a lot of flexibility for placement. Some songs leave the pre-chorus out of the second verse, but then return to it later in the song as a pseudo-bridge.

Some songs only use it once in the first verse. I've even seen it return after the last chorus in the fade-out section of the recording. The thing to remember is you have a powerful tool with a pre-chorus to add an extra hook to your song.

Word to the Wise I have heard songs repeat so much of the familiar that the listener becomes bored before they even reach the second verse. Trust me, even your mama will struggle to listen through three minutes of this and she loves you like no other.

Post-Chorus The popularity of the post-chorus is perhaps one of the biggest changes to the arc in the last few decades. The post-chorus is the short section that follows after the chorus and before the second verse. It can be achieved by repeating your title in interesting rhythms and melodies or by adding a sing-along chant like na-na-na-na. It can have completely new words and melody.

Think of it as a second chorus and a chance for your audience to sing or jam for a few more bars. Check out the post-chorus of Maroon 5's song Girls Like You. If the concept of a post-chorus is new to you, take a moment to listen to the track as you read the words.

You'll gain a better sense of how the post-chorus works. Chorus Girls like you Run around with guys like me Till sundown when I come through I need a girl like you Yeah yeah Girls like you Love fun Yeah me too What I want When I come through I need a girl like you Yeah, yeah Post chorus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need a girl like you. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need a girl like you. Yeah. Yeah Make sure you listen to the example girls like you for verse chorus post chorus melody art open line repetition trick a final repetition technique involves taking the opening line of a tune and and repeating it at the very end of the song so it is the last thing the listener hears.

It brings the listener full circle. When used correctly, it will leave them feeling satisfied intellectually and emotionally. Check out my song, She Thinks She Needs Me, sung by Andy Griggs.

It is a perfect illustration of this bookend repetition.

The song opens with the words, She thinks I walk on water, and uses the same line to end the song. When repeating sections of a song, it's important to trust our gut to find the balance between hooky and boring. The best balance is between the familiar and the new. First, we have to establish the familiar. Once we've drawn the listener in and given them something to recognize and return to, the next task is to create enough of the new to keep the listener interested and engaged.

One important way to do this is to offer contrast between song sections. Contrast between sections. You want to hold the listener's interest? Let them know where they are in the song arc and the story by generating enough contrast between sections.

If the verse provides fast-paced rhythms and short notes, perhaps the pre-chorus or chorus that follows the verses should stretch out a bit and the note should be held longer.

Country singer-songwriter Thomas Rhett does this well in many of his songs. Listen to him sing Unforgettable, written by Thomas Rhett, Jesse Fraser, Ashley Gorley, and Shane McAnally.

The verses and lyrics are fast-paced with a steady stream of short notes. At the pre-chorus, he stretches out a long note and the lyric WHOA. This serves several purposes.

First, it clues in the listener so they know they're now in a new section, the pre-chorus. Secondly, it offers rhythmic contrast to the verse and that holds their attention.

Finally, it builds tension and propels the momentum forward. Visualize these long held notes in the pre-chorus as an archer pulling back the string of his bow. This creates enough tension so that when he has let go of that arrow, it springs forward.

Much the same, an effective pre-chorus builds tension and then launches the listener into the chorus. Even though the chords and guitar strum patterns stay the same throughout much of the song, the rhythm of the words is sung differently enough in each section that the listener knows when the verse is over.

They intuit that the song is going somewhere else right before the chorus. The listener also knows when the chorus comes in and repeats. Together, these elements contributed to a compelling melody arc that propelled the song to the top 20 on the country charts, selling enough to be certified platinum.

Verse Melody vs. Chorus Melody Another way to create a compelling melody arc is to use a smaller note range, low to high, in the verse and then let loose with a bigger, rangier chorus melody. Over the decades, many hit songs have had verse melodies with only a very small note range using only three or four notes. Why so few? Think of it this way. The job of the verse melody is to set the mood and tone of the song.

That's it. You don't want to give too much away. It's kind of like going on a first date. You're making interesting conversation but not spilling your whole life story in the first few minutes. You want to save a little mystery for following dates. If you compose a verse melody with a huge note range, then you've got nowhere interesting to go when you hit the chorus.

The best songs set up the chorus in a way that allows the listener to connect with the song's emotion. Whether you feel like crying or dancing, it's usually the chorus that tugs your heart the hardest.

So try starting your songs with a conversational verse melody and then introduce the big emotion, in the chorus. Check out the verse melodies of Hello by Adele or Unforgettable by Thomas Rhett.

Both songs spend the majority of the verse hovering around a three-note melodic range. In my Grammy-nominated song, Beautiful Mess sung by Diamond Rio, the entire first two lines of each verse section are limited to only two notes.

Or listen to the opening melody of the Beatles singing I am the walrus. The opening melodic sequence of the verse is also two notes. The most extreme version of this is the song One Note Samba written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.

Notice how far he stretches a single note through half of his verse. Great writers understand that the job of the initial verse melody is to be conversational and invite the listener in.

Generally, they keep the melody less varied in the verses and then introduce a bigger melodic range in the chorus to create a compelling melodic arc. Of course, there are always exceptions to this.

Jazz standards often include the big lyrical idea in the verses and have a bridge rather than a traditional chorus. So, the verses need a bigger melodic range. However, in verse chorus style songs, when the listener arrives at the chorus, they should know it's the chorus, not only because it repeats throughout the song, but also because it has a certain energy that makes them want to sing along.

This often means the chorus starts on a higher note and is sung in a higher range than the verses. My co-author Bill was pitching a song to a publisher. After listening through about half the song, the publisher stopped and asked, which part is the chorus?" Bill began to answer, but the publisher stopped him to say, if I have to ask, that means there isn't a chorus.

That's a snarky way of teaching a lesson, but after that, Bill made sure he never presented a song where the listener couldn't identify the chorus. The Right Margin Test Another way to ensure contrast between and within song sections is to vary the line and word lengths.

Check out the following verse-chorus example I've created here to make the point. Verse I woke up this morning in Montana. The sky was dark and almost gray. I took it as a sign a storm's a coming.

Like when you know it's gonna rain. Chorus So if you're leaving, go on and go. Don't think twice about being kind. line, because my heart will hurt just the same if you break it now or take your time.

If you were looking at this on a page, you would see that the right margin is pretty much a straight line all the way down the page, four verse lines all the same length, followed by four chorus lines of the same length.

Whenever I see this, it almost always means the melody will not have enough contrast between the verse and chorus. Every melody line will probably be the same length as well.

Now compare this to the old rock and roll classic AC DC's back in black verse back in black. I hit the sack been too long. I'm glad to be back. Yes, I'm let loose from the noose that's kept me hanging about. I've been looking at the sky because it's getting me high. Forget the hearse because I'll never die. I got nine lives, cat's eyes, abusing every one of them, and running wild.

Chorus. Cause I'm back. Yes I'm back. Well I'm back. Yes I'm back. Well I'm back back. Well I'm back in black. Yes I'm back in black. When you listen to back in black, the verse and chorus are melodically very different.

So let's apply that right margin test. Write it down. The first clue is that the verse lines are much longer than the chorus lines. In fact, the song's melody has many short rapid-fire notes in the verse while the chorus notes are long held on the word lack. This is just the kind of contrast necessary to keep a listener's attention throughout the entire song arc. We know when this song hits the chorus because we experience a completely different melodic and rhythmic feel.

One of the common mistakes I see when coaching aspiring writers is that their songs don't pass the right margin test. Put it into practice. Pull out some of your favorite songs you've written.

Now look at your lyrics typed out. Are the lines the same length all the way down on the right side of the page? The answer is yes. This is a clue you might not have enough contrast between sections.

Time for a rewrite. This also serves as a good melody check when writing brand new songs. Starting the song sections or lines on different beats. For contrast between song sections, start the vocal melody on different beats in different sections.

For example, if a song uses the most common time signature, 4-4, that means there are four beats to the measure. The verse melody may enter at beat one. To contrast, start your chorus melody before the first beat, that's often called the pickup, or start it on the half beat between the first and second beats, on the one and, or on the second or third beat, whatever feels right and different.

Many non-commercial songs have the vocal melody starting on the same beat in every section. Although a subtle point, this can make a song less interesting to the ear. Most professional songwriters do this intuitively, but they also deliberately change things when there is too much repetition in a song.

Put it into practice. As you practice your inspired listening, tap and count along with the beat of the songs. Notice on which beat of the bar the verse vocals begin and on which beat the choruses begin. Be aware of how your favorite songs vary the vocal entrances to create contrast between sections. Next, listen to a few of your songs. If you start each section on the same beat, try changing it up.

Experiment. Add this as another melody check when working on your new songs. Breakdown Choruses Add contrast and flavor to your song arc by including a breakdown chorus, usually in the last part of the song. This involves playing or strumming less under your melody in the first part or in the whole chorus. Or when producing the song, this involves dropping out some of the instruments that are part of the previous choruses. This changes the dynamics and signals the listener for a finale that comes in like gangbusters with full instrumentation. This is typically a musical arrangement device, but often it can involve reworking or removing some of the lyric.

For instance, here is an example of a chorus I wrote with Marty Dodson and Joey Ebach. Chorus. No look back town. Once you break out. Man you don't turn around. It's all in my rear view now.

It's a no look back town. A no look back town. If I wanted to write a breakdown chorus, I could pull most of the backing instruments out of the track and simply repeat the first vocal line of the chorus a few times. I could insert some musical space between the two lines and then come back full strength with the entire backing track for the last chorus. Breakdown. No look back town.

Musical space. No look back town. Musical space. Chorus. No look back town. Once you break out, man you don't turn around. It's all in my rear view now. It's a no look back town.

A no look back town. The idea is to create tension before coming in with that final big chorus. Getting momentarily quiet in a song builds the kind of tension that signals the big chorus is coming, the calm before the storm.

It's simply another way to add contrast and interest to your song art. Pro tip, each section of a song can have its own arc, especially choruses. Start noticing how standout songs develop choruses from start to finish.

Many choruses start out with the first two lines having similar or identical melodies. Then the third line might do something completely different like interval jumps before returning to the melody of the original lines for the conclusion of the chorus. This produces a chorus arc within the whole of the wider song arc. There are many ways this can be accomplished. By practicing inspired listening, you will start incorporating new techniques into your own songs.

You don't have to know a lot of chords. One of the biggest complaints I hear from new songwriters is that they wish they knew more chords. When Bill started getting into songwriting sessions with professional writers, one thing that initially surprised him was that they often used the same few chords throughout the song.

Bill had been under the impression that to establish contrast between song sections, he had to incorporate a new set of chords for each section. One day, Bill was co-writing with pro songwriter Keezy Timmer and brought in a title that Keezy liked. it. So he asked if Bill had any chord patterns in mind. So he played a short series of chords that he had been messing around with. Keezy liked the groove, so they wrote a verse to those chords.

Then Bill asked, where shall we go for the chorus? Keezy said, same chords, and began singing an entirely different melody and melodic rhythm over the same chords. Bill was impressed.

When they got to the bridge, he was sure they would go somewhere else and find different chords. But no, Keezy just had Bill play those same chords again to create yet a third melody and melodic rhythm.

Lesson learned. I don't tell you this to limit your creativity or desire to learn more about your craft. But you should never let a lack of formal training stop you from writing a classic right now.

There are many songs with two chords, even more with three chords and four chords. You don't have to know hundreds of full chords with minor flatted fifths and augmented elements or be a prodigious player to write interesting songs with variable melodies.

However, you do have to use melody and rhythm to create contrast and keep your song arcs interesting. Study the songs mentioned in the first chapter that only have a few chords. Learn how the pros use the limitation of few chords to their advantage. Put it into practice. Now that you know the many ways skilled songwriters create contrast between song sections, take some time to practice inspired listening.

Check out 20 well-known or hit songs to identify these elements. Can you identify the chorus? How do you know where it is, including the first time it comes around? Does the song have a bridge?

How does the bridge change from the usual pattern from the verses or the chorus? Does it have a different rhythmic pattern or a different melody? Is it in a different key?

What are the different elements used in the verses from the chorus? Longer or shorter notes? Different melody rhythms? Faster or slower note pacing? • Contrasting note ranges • A lift in the chorus melody • Does the song have a pre-chorus, with long-held notes that build tension and slingshot you into the chorus?

I always make a point to consciously listen to song arcs. I love to check out how other writers, musicians, and producers take their listeners on a journey. It's been said that in order to be a good follower, so allow yourself to go on the journey of good songs and pay attention to the details of the arc along the way.

One final thought on melody arcs. While they do encompass song structure, verse, chorus, bridge, etc., they go beyond that. Melody arcs use structure as one element of the emotional intensity map of a song. Note selection, chords, and rhythm patterns are additional components in the total equation. Chapter 3 Recap ARC ARC is the musical and emotional journey of a song, the rise and fall of melodic intensity over the course of an entire tune.

Melodic contrast between sections is vital for building an effective ARC and keeping the listener engaged. It is not necessary to know a plethora of chords to build an effective arc.

Studying arcs from classic and modern songs will quickly develop good instincts for building your own arcs.

Part 2. Fine-tuning Your Melodic Sense

1. Developing Melodic Flexibility and Skills Though many songwriters edit their lyrics to improve them, as a mentor and teacher, I find songwriters new to the craft often hang on to the first melody that comes.

Newsflash, your first melodic take may not be your best. My rule of thumb, if a melody feels like it's been done before by either me or someone else, I keep pushing until I create something that excites me and feels fresh.

I never settle. Period. It's easy as a writer to get stuck in the rut of using the same old chords, rhythms, and melodies. By using the techniques in mastering melody writing, you can experiment with different ways to phrase melody lines and break free of any rut.

One of my early mentors, Rick Berg, offered the best advice, dare to suck. Those words in his colorful NYC accent and attitude gave me the confidence to experiment and try ideas without worrying if they were good or bad.

This mindset allowed me to discover better ideas more often. 2. Put into practice. Dare to suck. Take a chorus melody from one of your songs that you think could be more inspiring and try a different rhythm to the melody.

Try introducing line plus three or any of the other variations of the line plus technique. Then decide whether this makes the song more compelling or adds nothing. You may need to adjust your lyrics a little.

Experiment with different line lengths and note lengths. Try a few interval jumps. Determine the beat on which the melody or vocal line begins and vary that. Maybe it will sound cooler starting before the downbeat of the chorus rather than after or vice versa or maybe not.

Listen back to an audio of your entire song and notice if the chorus lifts enough so the listener will know it's a chorus. Does the emotional intensity build when you get to the chorus?

Note there are no rules. So have fun trying different techniques. With the tools you have already learned in this book, you can now begin to edit your melodies just like you would your lyrics.

If after making a few of these changes, you decide you still like your first version best. No harm, no foul. You can always go back to the original but more often than not I think you'll uncover a better melody by experimenting.

This can make the difference between an okay song and one people can't stop singing. Did you know country legend Hank Williams used to take an existing song and write new lyrics to it?

Then he would take those new lyrics and compose a completely new melody. The new song was entirely his but it had the ghostly bones of some previous hit song or song that he loved.

I've used this same rewriting exercise in my Songtown Masterclasses for 8 years and it's made a huge impact on my students' melody writing process. It's a great way to get more flexible with your melodies.

It teaches you to come at a melody from different angles and break free of ruts when you feel stuck, especially if you rewrite the melodies to famous songs that are ingrained in your head.

Let's be experimental. Try a few of these flexibility building exercises. Don't worry about writing a masterpiece. It's about getting into top melody writing shape for the next time you have a writing session or get inspired.

Put Into Practice Take a famous song, one where you know the lyric and melody inside out, and write a new melody to the existing lyrics and the existing chords. Now, try playing a completely new chord progression and writing a second new melody to the existing lyrics.

Now, rewrite the melody again, limiting the verse to a three note range, meaning three adjacent notes on a keyboard. Do whatever you want in the chorus, but create good contrast between the verse and chorus.

Finally, rewrite the song again using different tools that you've learned to create melody and contrast. Line plus, shapeshifting, interval jumps, etc. After you do this exercise a few times, you will have developed the ability to edit your melodies like you would your lyrics.

Note, choose a song that has a verse chorus structure to get the most out of this exercise.

Don't marry your melodies Simply put, don't marry the first melody or even the second melody that finds you. Professional songwriters often try several different lyrics and melodies before they settle on a final one.

Ego and attachment are secondary to whatever makes the song better. Develop the ability to detach from your melodies enough to try new variations, especially if they make the song better or more hooky.

Grab hooky melody patterns from your lyric. When writing a melody to a lyric, one of your chief jobs is to make that lyric stand out and be memorable. Let's write an opening lyrical line to a fictional song.

I remember waking up thinking that I'd had enough of the bad stuff. We could sing these words as one long continuous line, right? But instead, let's look at some clues the words give us. Look for rhyming words. When pulling melody clues from a lyric, the first thing I look for are internal rhymes. We have three words here that rhyme with each other. I remember waking up thinking that I had had enough of the bad stuff.

Break it into parts. Now look for ways to break the lyric line into bit-sized parts with at least two parts having an equal number of syllables. I remember waking up thinking that I'd had enough of the bad stuff.

In this example, I've divided the line into two sections of seven syllables and a single section of four. I love that each of these sections end with a rhyme word. This creates nice hot spots to play with. At this point, I can compose a melodic rhythmic pattern on the first seven syllables for the words, I remember waking up. Once I've established this pattern, I can repeat it identically on the second seven syllables.

Instantly this becomes a hook, making the line more memorable than if I'd simply sung it all the way through as one continuous line. Finally, I am left with the last four syllables that will resolve the melody line in a different way.

Now, you will notice that the first two rhyme words, up and enough, have the same exact melody note. Putting the same melody on rhymes creates more hookiness. Perhaps I'll include an interval jump upward on the words up and enough.

By taking the melody up on the word up, we use a technique I call word painting. More hookiness. More on word painting later. Look for patterns of three. Can you do a line plus three?

I remember waking up, thinking that I'd had enough of the bad stuff. So, by altering the melody to take advantage of line plus three, we gain an additional technique to make this line sticky.

Let's take a look at all of the hooks. Repeated melody pattern on the seven sections. Repeated rhythmic pattern on the seven sections. Same melody note on the first two rhyming words.

Word painting, line plus three technique. Do you see that breaking down a lyric line into bite-sized patterns frees your melody to elevate to the next level? This creates a powerful marriage of words and melody.

The best part is, it's all hiding inside the lyric waiting to be found. You just have to learn how to recognize it. Put into practice Review the opening lyric line to one of your existing songs and ask yourself, does it contain internal rhymes that you can use?

Break the line into bite-sized parts. Try to create sections with an equal number of syllables.

Experiment with five of the techniques we've studied in this book. Line plus, interval jumps, shapeshifting, using the same melody note on rhyming words, repeating a rhythmic pattern within the line.

Rewrite the melody of the lyric line three or four different ways. Be creative.

Blend Genres Don't be afraid to blend and bend genres. Ray Charles began his legendary career by blending R&B lyrics with churchy gospel-feeling rhythms. World had never heard this before.

This genre blending launched Ray into super stardom. Run-D.M.C. combined their rap sensibilities with Rocker's Aerosmith on Walk This Way. The result was so powerful that it revived Aerosmith's career for another decade of hits. Michael Jackson brought legendary guitarist Eddie Van Halen into the studio to play a finger-tapping rock guitar solo on his classic pop song Beat It. This helped Michael tap into a whole new fan base and widen his appeal.

More recently, rapper Lil Nas X and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus combined their talents on the huge smash Old Town Road. music history is filled with stories of artists blending genres.

It's a technique that won't go out of style anytime soon.

Co-write with great melody writers.

There's a saying that if you are the smartest person in the room, then you'll never learn anything. When I got my first publishing deal as a staff writer, I knew melody came naturally to me. But some sessions, I'd be asked to co-write with a recording artist who didn't write lyrics. I was expected to supply lyrics on the spot, so I knew I had to improve my lyric game and quickly I had to conjure myself into a hit lyricist.

One of the first things I did was get into the co-writing room with exceptional lyricists. I paid attention to the things they focused on. I could see firsthand what made Tia Sillars a Grammy-winning lyricist.

I watched her build words in a chorus that could hit you in the gut and make you cry. I got to see how Hall of Fame writer Rory Bork approaches the writing of a second verse differently than the first.

I didn't start out writing with these great writers, but worked my way into those rooms little by little over time. The better my songwriting skills got, the better my co-writers got.

I learned how to do the things I wanted to do by surrounding myself with people who were better than me. I eventually learned how to write hit lyrics to complement my melodic abilities.

You can learn to grow your melody writing skills beyond your wildest expectations with the same approach. Trust me, In time, it will rub off. We often hear that in order to master a skill, it takes 10,000 hours.

Think about it. When you co-write, you also reap the benefits of your co-writer's 10,000 hours as well. We share our expertise and experience with our co-writers and vice versa.

Light bulbs will go off and you'll speed up your learning curve tenfold. You'll want to pay special attention to how great melody writers mentally approach their craft.

If you are new to co-writing, joining a community of writers who co-write has many advantages. Most of our members in Songtown co-write together and are extremely supportive of each other.

Even folks who don't live in the same town or country co-write via the internet with tools like Zoom, FaceTime, or Google Hangouts. If you are in a town with the local writers' nights and you hear a great melody person performing, go up and introduce yourself.

Ask if they ever co-write. It is hard to learn in a vacuum. You will learn faster by working with talented people. Build Confidence as a Melody Writer Confidence is crucial to great melody writing.

How do we build our confidence? confidence, how do we get into a rhythm and keep it flowing? Write on a regular basis. Whether you feel inspired or not, write. When you are uninspired and still plant your butt in the chair, you often will be struck with new melody ideas.

Think of it as sitting and inviting the muse to join you. Glenn Fry of the Eagles wrote some of the most iconic tunes of all time. His writing partner and Hall of Fame writer Jack Temption shared with me how they would work on their songs.

Jack would arrive at Glenn's house. Glenn would light candles in the writing room to invite the muse to join them. He was confident that the muse would offer inspiration if they were patient.

Even if he had zero ideas, he believed the inspiration would come. And it did. Over and over. The Eagles sold more albums than any American band in history and wrote some legendary songs.

So Glenn obviously knew a thing or two about being creative. You can't achieve that level of confidence without putting in the work. Sit your butt in the chair enough times and the muse will see that you mean business.

Practice the Talk-Sing Method I mentioned this early in Mastering Melody Writing, but I can't think of a better way to build confidence than with the Talk-Sing Method. Practicing this method will develop quick reflexes for hearing words and then turning them into melody.

Remember, there is no right or wrong. you'll experience a sense of melodic freedom when you start turning words into any melodic emotion that strikes you. It's like practicing guitar scales for songwriters.

You want it to become automatic. As I move through my day, I do this any chance I get.

Spend Time Spitballing In country writing rooms, many sessions begin end with a lyrical hook or title. The talk-sing method is perfect for learning to quickly turn a title or phrase into the right melody and emotion.

But in the pop world, melody reigns supreme. Often writers will spitball melodies first and then figure out the lyric later in the writing process. Sometimes even after the complete melody is written, the main focus is finding the hookiest melody first.

So what is spitballing? Let's say you have an 8 or 16 bar chord pattern that you've recorded and looped on your computer. You grab a microphone, press the record button, and begin to improvise whatever melodies come out.

At this point, you're not worried about what words you're singing. You might hum, mumble, or sing whatever words you feel, even if they are nonsense words. Remember the Phil Collins song, Susudio?

The story goes that Phil spitballed his melody in the studio on a vocal mic over an instrumental track they had completed earlier. As they listened back to the vocal track, they loved the melody.

There's a girl that's been on my mind all the time. Su-su-sudio. Now she don't even know my name, but I think she likes me just the same. Su-su-sudio." He had sung the nonsense syllables with the idea later to replace them with actual words.

When repeated attempts to produce those words failed, he thought, what the heck, it sounds good, it's fun, let's keep it, and a classic nonsense syllable song was born.

Certainly every song can't be nonsense lyrics, so spitballing requires is awareness of any words or phrases that fall out in the creative process. They often give clues to what the song wants to be about and can serve as a starting point for fashioning a complete, cohesive lyric later in the process.

Today, many contemporary artists from Pops the Weekend to country music Sam Hunt use this technique in their creative process. In spitballing, the melody takes precedent. It must feel good and always sound natural. The phrases should sound to the listener as if they were created effortlessly. The hard trick is sounding like it was easy. Put it into practice.

Take an 8 or 16 bar phrase and loop it for 2 minutes. Begin with trying to find a chorus melody first.

Record a pass of spitballing for 2 minutes and listen back. Are there any hooky parts you can keep? Take another pass at the loop. Listen for more hooks. You'll want to keep doing this until you have a memorable chorus melody.

After you have your chorus mapped out, work on your verse. Note, don't be afraid to write multiple versions of melody over the same loop. It will give you options when trying to match the right verse to the right chorus. Pro tip, try not to overthink the spitballing process. Melody comes from an instinctual place. Get feedback from people you trust. Playing your songs for people who have expertise and who will be honest with you is invaluable to building your confidence.

A good mentor is crucial to your writing progress. I was blessed early in my journey to have a few successful writers take me under their wing. They saw I had a talent, a passion for writing, and worked hard.

They would share their advice and often make suggestions on how to improve my songs. Sometimes it was just an attaboy, and that helped my confidence. That's what we do every day at Songtown. We pass down years of songwriting knowledge to help aspiring writers of all ages and backgrounds become their best songwriter selves. And it's as rewarding for me to see one of my Songtown members have success as it is to see my own name on the Billboard charts.

We all keep Keep the art of songwriting alive and thriving together. Put more tools in your toolbox. Try showing up to play at a golf tournament knowing you only have one club in your bag.

No matter how talented you are, it's tough to have a shot at winning without all the tools you need. The same is true in songwriting. If you are a one-trick pony, your melodies will become stale and boring. You won't feel inspired and neither will the audiences listening to your songs. However, by learning new techniques and consistently adding tools to your toolbox, you will gain the confidence to write from a more inspired place.

I can't tell you how cool it is to see my students get excited when they use a new tool in their writing. Here's a moving email I got from Nick Sariano after a recent masterclass I taught.

My mind was blown by the line plus concept in last night's class. I'm a Berklee music grad and have been making my living as a session musician, recording engineer, teacher for the last 30 years.

And how I didn't know about this formula makes me feel like a total amateur. To make a long story even longer, I was at the gym this morning on the redundant bike listening to the music they were pumping into the gym.

Lo and behold, a stream of line plus three came at me like gangbusters. Damn. Mind blown. Super inspired. Now, this is the kind of excitement that comes from learning. It makes writing so much more fun.

And it builds confidence.

Build Confidence as a Melody Writer

Chapter 5 Clay's Essential Tools Over the course of your songwriting journey, you will grow and add many new tools to your toolbox. So far, Mastering Melody Writing has laid out new techniques to show you how to be your own lifelong teacher with practices like inspired listening and the talk-sing method.

Now I want to share with you a few essential tools that have helped me write better songs over the years. It's fun to think of these in terms of what you'd find in a carpenter's toolbox.

What can I say? I spent my childhood summers on a farm in the Mississippi Delta. The angle tool Use for approaching your songs from different angles when you get stuck.

We've all experienced the frustration of having part of a song come in a flash and then nothing. Crickets We were on a cool ride and hit a wall in figuring where to take the song next.

Perhaps it's the chorus that comes quickly, but the verse sounds boring or uninspired, right? In the early stages of learning to write songs, I had a habit of getting stuck.

And worse, after getting stuck, I would focus so intently on the problem that I couldn't see the answer. I had not yet learned how to step back from my song and come at it from a fresh angle.

Years later, when I finally worked my way into the room with accomplished writers, I saw how easily these writers were able to turn a corner at a sticking point, to come at the problem with a new approach and keep the song moving along.

They understood the flow of the writing room. The good news is there are countless techniques for getting unstuck, but they all fall under the umbrella of the angle. Here are a few things to keep in mind while developing your tools.

Treat your songwriting like a grand experiment. A quote that profoundly impacted my own songwriting is from Tunesmith by Hall of Fame songwriter Jimmy Webb. Jimmy's mentor, Michael Bennett, smiled as they entered a writing room and said, In this room, you can never make a mistake.

Until that point, I had never thought about creativity in such freeing terms. We should give ourselves total freedom and permission to try anything and then to keep on trying options until we find the right one. I remember a friend playing me some outtakes from an old Beatles recording session. I was shocked at how one of the most influential bands of all time would freely experiment with their songs. they would take a classic-to-be into the studio and try different tempos, chord substitutions, or even different time signatures before landing on the version ultimately immortalized on vinyl.

The songs didn't need to come to them in their final form. They searched and experimented until it was right. Step back from the problem. If you find yourself getting stuck or frustrated, take a deep breath and do something else.

Take a walk. Exercise. Work on another song. After a break, come back and play your song from the beginning to see where it leads you. It's like you have a new set of ears.

Try a different groove or tempo. I cannot tell you how many times I've written a verse melody and lyric and after working so hard, I'm still not feeling it. At this point, I'll try a completely different groove under my lyric. This can lead to some amazing results. I learned this cool trick from Hall of Fame writer Mike Reed who wrote some of my all-time favorite songs. The story goes that Mike and his co-writer Alan Shamblin had been stuck on an uptempo bluegrass song for months.

One day, Mike was playing his piano and the solution hit him. He took the lyrics and melody from the uptempo bluegrass song and started playing a ballad groove below it, a total 180 degrees from the original groove. That song became the huge pop smash I Can't Make You Love Me, recorded by legendary artists like Bonnie Raitt, George Michael, and Prince. Drum loops work well for inspiring new melody angles too.

Sometimes I'll sing along to an iPhone drum machine app called iMachine, trying new beats. Simply changing the tempo of your beat to faster or slower can lead the song in a new direction.

Switch instruments. Another way to unstick yourself is to switch instruments as you're writing. Often, I'll start a song on guitar and then switch to piano or vice versa.

Different instruments evoke different feelings and emotions, especially if you write predominantly on one particular instrument. We all fall prey to ruts and hanging out where we're most comfortable.

Don't Don't worry if you can't play a certain instrument well. Often this is a plus. Mistakes can lead us to new and wonderful melodies. Hand Saw – Use for editing and sawing off entire sections of a song One issue I run into over and over again in my mentoring sessions is how easy it is to write songs that are way too long. If your song has a third verse, one that puts it over five minutes and simply rehashes the second verse lyric idea, get rid of the extra verse. Don't bore us, get to the chorus.

Why not? It's the part of the song your audience loves to sing along to. Today, songs are slanted toward the chorus. So, let's look at one way to use your Saul. Here's a verse and chorus lyric to a top five song of mine, She Thinks She Needs Me, recorded by Andy Griggs.

Verse 1 She thinks I walk on water, She thinks I hung the moon, She tells me every morning, They just don't make men like you. She thinks I got it together, her, swears I'm tough as nails.

But I don't have the heart to tell her. She don't know me that well. The chorus? She don't know how much I need her. She don't know how I'd fall apart without her kiss, without her touch, without her faithful loving arms.

She don't know it's all about her. She don't know I can't live without her. She's my world. She's my everything, and she thinks she needs me." Notice that the verse has eight lines and then the chorus begins.

When we originally wrote this song, we had a second verse with another eight lines. However, after playing and singing the entire song, we felt the second verse took too long to return to the chorus.

So, we reached for our tool belt and solved the second verse music and lyrics in half. Here's what happened. Verse 2 Sometimes she cries on my shoulder when she's lying next to me.

She don't know that when I hold her, she's really holding me, holding me. She don't know how much I need her. She don't know I'd fall apart. Without her kiss, without her touch, without her faithful, loving arms.

She doesn't know it's all about her. She doesn't know I can't live without her. She's my world. She's my everything. She thinks she needs me. At first it might feel like you're butchering your song or ripping out a part of you.

It can be hard to let go of words and music that you've poured your heart into. But we have a saying in Nashville, the song is king. We always do what is best for the song and what gives the song its best chance of impacting the listener.

In fact, our original bridge to She Thinks She Needs Me contained four lines of words and melody. My publisher challenged my co-writers, Shane Miner, Sonny Lemaire, and me to say the same thing in one line.

So our one-line bridge turned out much better than our original four-liner, which wandered into unnecessary territory. Bridge. Funny thing is, she thinks she's the lucky one.

Chorus. She don't know how much I need her. She don't know I'd fall apart, without her kiss, without her touch, without her faithful loving arms. She don't know it's all about her.

She don't know I can't live without her. She's my world. She's my everything. She thinks she needs me.

Exacto Knife Use for eliminating unnecessary notes and tightening your rhythm patterns. The exacto knife is similar to the handsaw. However, it's used to make smaller, finer cuts.

For instance, let's say your song has a hooky rhythmic pattern in the chorus that is established on the opening line. May your joy be unspeakable. Then you realize the next line of your lyric is 90% the same but you have more syllables in the second lyric line, so you add a few extra melody notes to accommodate the lyric.

And your love always be undeniable. It's time to break out the exacto knife and start trimming the excess. Let's cut away the two words always and be. You've established a hooky rhythm in the first line, so go ahead and repeat that exact goodness in the second line. May your joy be unspeakable And your love undeniable 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 Now each line has the same number of syllables, eights, and the same hooky pattern. This creates symmetrical patterns.

Repetition is ear candy. The new edited lyric rolls off the tongue in a more musical way. The goal is to write clear, melodic, or rhythmic hooks and not muddy the waters with extraneous notes.

Paint Brush Use to amplify a lyric's meaning by mirroring it with music. Word painting is one of the most underutilized devices for injecting hookiness in a song. It fills the gap between music and words, marrying the two, so to speak. Over the years, I have heard word painting called a few different names to describe this musical illumination of words such as tone painting in the classical community or prosody in poetry circles.

However, none of these names fully encompass the art of bringing a lyric to life by reflecting it with music and or melody. To me, word painting is coloring the emotion, action, or natural sounds of a lyric with its musical counterpart.

It's a device that has been around for centuries, dating back to the Gregorian chants. It's found its way into every modern genre from rock, rap, jazz, and country. When they go low, you go low.

Take a listen to Garth Brooks singing I've Got Friends in Low Places. The most fun part of the whole chorus is when Garth sings the word low. The melody dips down the octave and hits an extremely low note on the word low.

The melody is literally doing what the word says when Garth drops low on the word low. The same effect is used on Elvis' last hit of his career, way on down. At the end of each chorus, when the king sings way on down, the melody goes way down as he hits the low notes on the word down.

So on the classic Joe Cocker hit, Love Lift Us Up, you can guess what the melody does, right? It starts lifting up and up for those words. With word painting, you have countless ways to enhance the emotion or action of a lyric through music and melody.

Parody the Lyric I remember Katy Perry talking about the writing process of her smash hit, Roar. She said the song was near completion, but they knew they didn't have a hit yet.

The song needed a big hook in the chorus to send it over the top. She said they spent days in the studio just working on one small section of the song trying to make the title grab the listener's attention.

Finally, after a week, it hit them. Katie needed to make her voice scoop up on the word roar. This mimicked exactly the sound scoop a lion makes when he roars. Go take a listen to the song if you haven't heard it. Adding this simple device transformed Roar into a very memorable song.

The Boomerang Check out Justin Timberlake's word painting on his hit song, What Goes Around. In the chorus, he sings descending notes, stepping down the octaves on the words, What comes around, comes around, comes around.

And then Then he starts ascending back up the scale on the words comes back around. He repeats the whole process over and over. The music paints the words for a full circle boomerang effect using nothing but his choice of melody notes.

Just roll with it. One Man Band is one of my favorite songs by the band Old Dominion. The chorus of their song begins this way. I don't want to be a one-man band. I don't want to be a Rolling Stone alone.

When lead singer Matthew Ramsey sings the words Rolling Stone alone, notice how the melody becomes a rolling series of notes, almost like rolling waves. You feel these words on a deeper level because the music imitates the exact emotion of the words.

By the way, did you catch the use of line plus three in the chorus? I don't want to be a one-man band. One, two, three. Can I Get an Amen?

Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen is one of the most covered songs in the world. It is a highly developed example of word painting, using minor and major chords where the lyric calls for it.

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, and the major lift, the baffled king composing Hallelujah. Let's break it down. The fourth. These two words sit atop the fourth chord of the scale.

The fifth. The melody moves up one note and the lyrics sit above the fifth chord of the scale. The minor fall. These words sit on the sixth chord of the scale, which is a minor chord. chord. The fall in this phrase refers to the fallen or lowered third which defines a minor chord. It's a sadder sounding chord as well, which sets up nicely. The Major Lift The lift refers to the chord changing from a minor chord to a major one.

It gives the feeling of lifting the harmony. There is only one note that changes between the minor and major chords. This happens when you lift the third note of the chord.

So, as you can see, word painting can be as simple or as complex as you make it. The end result should always be the same though. Hook magic. Reverse word painting. One of the dangers of learning new techniques is developing the tendency to think that they are absolute rules that can't be broken.

In fact, doing the opposite of what the lyric is saying can be even more effective. Check out the smash pumped up kicks by the American band Foster the People. Their lyric tackles the dark subject of a kid contemplating a school shooting.

Yet the music is pure bubblegum pop. This is an example where reverse word painting is absolutely the best way to broach a dark storyline. Can you imagine if the music was as dark as the lyric?

It would be hard to imagine many people sitting through an entire song of that. With their reverse approach though, they are able to bring the message of the song to the masses.

Difficult subjects often benefit from this reverse technique. Groove Painting Bruce Springsteen is a master of this technique. Check out his song, I'm On Fire, from the Born in the USA album.

It utilizes what drummers call a train beat throughout. 1-2-1-2-3-4. The drums sound like a train chugging down the tracks. So what does the boss do in the verse of I'm on Fire, he writes a lyric line about a train.

It's almost certainly by design because the first two-thirds of the lyric make no mention of trains. But in this verse, it's a brilliant way to glue the music and words together by word painting.

At night I wake up in the sheets soaking wet And the freight train running through the of my head." Springsteen takes the word painting a step further at the end of the song when he uses his voice to simulate a train whistle.

As you practice your daily routine of inspired listening, pay attention to how melody, production, groove, and chords wrap themselves around the lyric. How does melody paint the emotion of the lyric you are listening to?

How does music bring the words to life. Put It Into Practice When discovering a new tool, it's important to put it into practice immediately while you're excited about it. Look for lyrical clues in one of your existing lyrics. Ask these kinds of questions. Can you take the melody higher or lower in places where the words indicate this? Can you integrate a more staccato or percussive melody because the Lyrics are about banging on a drum.

Work hard to extract the musical emotion of the lyric. Your goal is to bring the words to life with melody, to connect the words and lyric so you can connect the minds and hearts of your listener.

The Level Use for checking your song to ensure it will matter to an audience.

When we write, it's normal to experience an initial creative burst. It's very exciting. Music and words fly out like they're coming from someone else. Maybe they're just handed to us.

But there comes a point in each song's development when it's necessary to step back and level with yourself. Ask, other than myself, who is going to care about this song?

After all, songs are a conversation between the singer and the audience. Whenever your songs are performed, you want the audience to feel the same emotions you felt when writing it.

In Pro Circles, we call it the give-a-hoot factor.

Well, our language may or may not be more colorful than the word hoot. The level is a tool I use in every writing session, whether I'm writing solo or co-writing. Over the years, I've developed my own checklist of things to look for.

It works well for both lyric and melody writing. Is the idea I'm writing unique and interesting, or has it been written this way before?

Does the melody seem fresh, or does it sound like 1983 called and wants their song back? Does the chorus melody have an emotional arc, does it rise and fall throughout the song, or does it stay on the same uneventful four notes for the entire song? Is the verse melody conversational enough to draw in the listener or is the melody too big in the verse causing my chorus emotion to fall flat? Are there enough melodic rhythmic hooks in the verse?

In the chorus? Are the hooks different enough in each section to keep it interesting? Do my chord progressions and groove create the right emotion to support the lyric? story, or have I thrown a distracting, complex chord in the middle of the verse that sounds more clever than believable?

Your level tool will change and develop as you progress as a writer. At first, it may be a bit more challenging to learn how to use this tool, but it's vital to start asking the question each time you write, who else is going to care about this? • Stepping back from your song allows you to see what is not working and then figure out how to fix it. Put yourself in the listener's shoes as if you are hearing the song for the first time.

Practice this and your songs will get better. • Writing ahead of the curve, or if you are not the lead dog, the scenery never changes.

Staying current is one of the biggest hurdles we writers face. In my mentoring sessions, it's not unusual to hear songwriters lamenting that publishers say their songs sound dated.

When I dig deeper, I find they are chasing the latest thing on the radio. Here's the problem with this approach. What's playing on the radio today typically has been written one or two years ago, sometimes even longer.

So constantly chasing the latest trend will put you behind the times. It's one thing to sound classic or timeless, but sounding dated is not going to inspire modern artists to record your songs.

So how do we stay ahead of the curve as writers? Here are the main things I've done in my own writing to remain relevant over a few decades. First rather than trying to sound like the latest thing, I practice inspired listening.

This helps build confidence. That confidence feeds everything I do as a writer. If I pick up one or two new tools I can use in my writing every week, that's a lot of tools.

Imagine your skill level after a few years of this. Secondly, I try to write the very best song I can every time I sit down to write. The song is king. I focus 95% of my energy on this rather than chasing trends.

If I am gathering new tools from the songs around me, I will be current. Ultimately, I want to create quality these songs. Thirdly, I try to co-write with the very best writers around me.

Record companies are a little behind what goes on in the real writing rooms. They put out today what great writers wrote yesterday. Songwriters are the front line of creation.

Surrounding yourself with the best co-writers provides a sense of camaraderie and often a community. It fosters an environment where you can take chances and make it easier to do the things that have not been done before.

Never underestimate the power of supportive co-writers, publishers, or friends. They can make or break your creative flow. Finally, I find I write my best when I'm writing as often as I can. It keeps all of my skills sharpened. Then, when a great stroke of inspiration hits, I can write a killer song because I'm ready. Even if it's only possible for you to write for 15 minutes today, your songs will thank you.

Do you see a pattern emerging? Listen. Learn. Write. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.

Chapter 6 Hooks, Ear Candy, and Emotion Bringing It All Together The Three R's Rhythm, Rhyme, and Repetition In mastering melody writing, I refer to the songs we like as being hooky.

Those are the songs we wake up singing from a concert the night before. This book has provided a diverse set of tools, principles, and ideas to make your songs hooky and more compelling so your listeners will want to hear them again and again.

I know we've covered a lot of territory in this book. If I had to boil everything down to the simplest summary, I would just say this. Master rhythm, rhyme, and repetition in your songwriting.

Rhythm. We've just skimmed the surface of lyrics, but rhyme married to rhythm and melodic repetition can make your songs stick in your listener's head. Most people think of melody as the pitch of the notes, but for me the rhythmic pattern of the notes is as important as the note pitches.

Rhythm is so basic to us as humans. We begin in our mother's wombs hearing the rhythm of her heartbeat. Rhythms surround us as we move through our day. And, in fact, many songwriters write to beats and tracks now since they've become relatively easy to create on computer recording programs, tablets, and phones.

These beats can inspire melodies and offer a framework for creating rhythmic lyrics and tunes.

Rhyme The primary focus of this book has been melody. However, melody is sound and words and rhymes are part of the sound. So as writers, learning to marry the right words with the right music will impact your listeners on a deeper level.

You can add power to your lyrics by marrying rhymes to certain melodic patterns. Start paying attention to how vowel sounds affect the mood of the song. Open vowels and darker vowels are comforting.

Hold on or lost in your arms. By contrast, bright vowels are uplifting and can make us smile. Let there be peace on earth. Owl sounds make us want to twist and shout or shout it from a mountain with happiness.

Remember, there are no at absolute rules and always exceptions. But start noticing the patterns. You'll become a more in-tune and thoughtful songwriter. Think about it.

Melody rhymes just like lyrics do. It's hard to separate the two when writing a great song. Work on matching certain melodic patterns with certain rhyme patterns and sounds to make your songs hookier and more emotionally impactful.

Repetition

Repeated melodic patterns do something to the human brain so that it gets hooked on the sound. My co-author Bill's family used to play a game on long car trips. They would each try to sing a song that was so addictive melodically that the others could not get out of their heads, singing sugar sugar da da da da da da, honey honey doo doo doo doo doo.

You are my candy girl, or it's a small world after all, is all it took to drive them mad. Late at night after one of these games, one of them would whine, I can't get to sleep, that song keeps playing over and over in my head. That is the power of melody. Good ones get stuck in our heads. Those songs almost always have a lot of melodic repetition in them. One of my songwriter friends co-wrote a song recorded by country star Blake Shelton called Doing It To Country Songs.

That line is repeated about 30 times in the three and a half minute song. It works well, and it makes you smile. Think also of the Bruce Springsteen song, Born in the USA.

I will bet that you cannot sing most of the verses in that song, but almost everyone who has heard it more than once or twice can sing the chorus, which repeats the title, many times. If you want a song to get stuck in your listener's head, use repetition wisely. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes it's overused and we can lose the listener. So find a balance between repeating and introducing new elements or varying the repeated parts.

Lifelong Melody Learning

The first time I got to co-write with a great songwriter, I was in my 30s and thought I knew a lot about songwriting. I mean, I had secured a staff writer deal with world-renowned publishing house EMI Music.

My song-plugger arranged for me to write with hall-of-fame songwriter Rory Burke, who by that time had a slew of No. 1 songs. I walked into the writing room and Rory told me he had just finished taking a songwriting class.

I thought I had heard incorrectly and asked, work. You're teaching it, right?" I was surprised when Rory said he was a student in the course. He wanted to keep learning and get better at his craft.

He taught me a valuable lesson that day. Great writers are lifelong learners. Paul Simon, long after he had written many hits, continued to take guitar lessons. We We know that his songs reached far beyond the folk music style where he began.

Though his songs remained commercial and pop style, they began incorporating more interesting and complex chord patterns, melodies, and rhythms. Remember when I mentioned that thinking of yourself as a corporation, as John Mayer did, is a good way to grow as a songwriter?

Rory Burke and Paul Simon also embraced this attitude and have garnered even more success and longevity as songwriters. I suggest the same attitude for you. Be a lifelong learner as a songwriter.

Train your intuition to write melodies using all of these principles. Go beyond what you know now to use the methods and techniques here in Mastering Melody Writing and keep discovering new tools as you journey.

Once you begin to raise your awareness of pattern repetition and arc in song melodies, you should begin to notice these elements so that you can emulate them and incorporate them into your own songwriting.

Don't worry if it takes some time to grasp these principles. Mastering melody writing is a noble pursuit.

A Case Study Lady Gaga's A Million Reasons A Million Reasons by Lady Gaga is a good case study for mastering melody writing principles. The song, co-written by Gaga, Nashville hit songwriter Hilary Lindsey, and hit pop songwriter producer Mark Ronson, was certified platinum and a top 10 song in charts all over the world.

The verses are both rhythmic melodically and relatively flat melodically. Most of the verse lines consist of only a single note. Remember, I call this a conversational verse melody. She raises the last note of each line to place her end lyrical rhymes, go show, hills still, stare aware, mean believe, making the verses more hooky. In raising that one note up, the word is emphasized.

The lines also have a lot of repetition, both melodically and lyrically. melody. It seems as if Gaga sings a million reasons almost a million times in the verses. Okay, not really, but she does sing those words a lot.

She introduces variations of the pattern after doing two repetitions. This keeps the listener's ears from getting fatigued. The melody sings in a rhythmic way, very choppy with short fast notes.

When the chorus hits, you definitely know you are in the chorus because the melody soars. The chorus melody features a lot of melodic variation. The chorus notes stretch, they are longer and held out. Then halfway through the chorus, Gaga uses interval jumps. This gives more contrast and keeps your attention, doesn't it? Keeps mine. She always puts rhymes on the repeated end-chorus melody lines to seal the deal.

Pray, way, stay, better, leather. I suggest you study this song as a master class in using the melodic principles I've spelled out in this book. Make your song matter. Songs can make the listener listen and feel something or change their lives.

Every culture and country in the world has its own music and song. Why? Why? Because we have a universal human need to communicate and connect emotionally with each other through music.

I'll bet you can think of more than one song that evokes the same emotion in you as the first time you heard it, every time it plays. That song takes you back to another time and place and that certain feeling.

Or you've probably heard a song or three that perfectly articulate how you feel about something or someone that you've never been able to put into words. I believe words and music together have the power to change people's lives.

I can't tell you how many times someone has come up to me after a show and said that a song I had on the radio got them through some of the hardest times in their lives.

A breakup, a sick loved one, a divorce. Songs have the power to heal and offer hope. Throughout Mastering Melody Writing, we've been discussing a number of technical aspects of melody. But I want to remind you that fundamentally, beyond all intellectual analysis, melodies move people emotionally. Music gets people to feel something. That is why we listen to it.

You often know whether a song is happy or sad by the melody alone. Listen to a few songs in a language you don't understand and I bet you can tell, most of the time, what emotion the song is conveying.

Developing Your Auralect vs. Your Intellect

One of the most frequent questions I get from students is, how do you know which notes to choose when writing a melody? It's a fair question for sure, but it comes from a place of desiring to intellectually understand an instinctual process.

In reality, when writing a song, I hear the notes and sing them, or I play them on an instrument. My voice is following my ear. ear. To be more specific, it follows the instincts of my ear.

I've always thought of composing as remembering a melody that has never been written.

That's as close as I've ever come to describing that feeling of instinctual composition. Intellectually, we can learn techniques like line plus. It's crucial to expand our mental understanding of melody.

However, to take melody writing to the next level of composition, you must turn off your intellect and trust what I call your auralect. In auralect moments, we are not intellectually thinking about melody.

We are hearing it. We are following where the ear takes us. How do we develop our auralect? Two things have been constant for me over the years, the talk-sing exercise, and developing my auralect by memorizing a lot of melodies.

I'm always singing melodies. When I hear a song in an elevator, I sing my own melodies above the tracks. If I'm walking around, I'm humming to myself, sometimes a little too loudly for passersby.

The Beatles wrote some of the greatest melodies in recorded music. However, they started out as a cover band. The Beatles played 8 hours a night in Hamburg during their formative years.

To play for 8 long hours, they had to know a lot of tunes. So, they didn't just play the latest popular rock and roll songs, they also learned Broadway tunes, Irish pub songs, and any style of music they could get their hands on.

It's a big reason why their music is so universally accepted around the world. The good thing is you and I don't have to play eight days a week. See what I did there? We can practice the talk-sing exercise or hum melodies along with the radio or TV.

Incorporating these types of creative activities as regular practice leads to more instinctual melodies. You can quickly develop your auralect with a little practice.

My Wish for You All of the tools and understandings I have presented in Mastering Melody Writing are in service of helping you write songs that engage and move your listeners.

A well-written and effective song can make the listener cry, cry, laugh, remember, feel happy or nostalgic, dance, or even change their minds about something.

Listen to a song like I Hope You Dance, co-written by my friend Tia Sellers. You can feel the emotion even beyond the lyrics. Or listen to Live Like You Were Dying, another song of the year, and experience the emotion conveyed through both the lyrics and the melody.

Successful Your songwriting communicates emotion through the notes, rhythms, patterns, repetition, and art. I hope mastering melody writing helps you capture and communicate authentic and moving emotions in your songs.

The world needs music more than ever now. Your songs can become a part of this living tradition that creates memories, evokes emotions, and touches people all over the world as you master the art and skill of melody writing.

Afterword We all come to songwriting from different paths with a wide array of motivations and goals. Some of us experience life-altering heartbreak or trauma and want to pour our emotions into song.

Some just like the challenge and fun of staring at a blank sheet of paper and seeing what it could become. Some want to become pros or perhaps have a well-known artist sing a song we've written.

It's also satisfying to get better at crafting a well-written song. For me it's been a combination of all of these things and more. Each day and each new song remains a mystery waiting to reveal itself.

But I warn you, to be a songwriter brings with it highs and lows. It can be lonely when friends or family don't understand your obsession. That's why it's important to find other like-minded creative souls who can help support you on your journey.

It's a big reason Marty Dodson and I started Songtown and why so many of our members around the world think of each other is family. It has been said that 95% of the art in the world is created by 5% of the population.

That makes us songwriters a unique breed. I would like to leave you with a story I have told at all of my live concerts over the past 10 years. When I first announced to my friends in New York City that I was going to Nashville to become a songwriter, I'm sure they were all surprised.

It's a big leap to pack up and move to a new town with only a dream and a prayer. But I was determined. The week I was scheduled to move, several friends threw a big going-away party at a Manhattan restaurant.

Well, it wasn't exactly a going-away party. It was more like an intervention. They tried to reason with me, and most of them made great points. I had a good job already, I had friends I could count on, and no one in Nashville was making plans to record my songs at that time.

All perfectly sane reasons from caring friends, but I forged on to Nashville. I was fortunate. I got a publishing deal with EMI Music and then I was unfortunate and lost that deal.

And so it went for seven years like that. I wrote daily. I stayed focused on my goal of becoming the best songwriter I could be. I sharpened my skills each day desiring to write better than the day before.

Every few months I would get phone calls from well-meaning friends asking me what on earth I was doing. Hadn't I had enough already? I could always move back to New York and work at writing music for commercials again.

There was good money in it, etc., etc., and I'll admit there were many times I wondered if I was doing the right thing. But I persisted, and when I finally wrote my first hit song, Beautiful mess.

Well, the week it went number one, I remember listening to many voicemails on my phone. And they all started out the same way. We knew you would make it. Dream on. Write on.

Glossary Clay's Songwriting Terms arc, the musical and emotional story arc of a song, the rise and fall of melodic intensity over the course of an entire song.

Auralect, the ability to follow your ear while composing, hearing where melody wants to take you. This involves the suspension of intellect and trusting inner instincts, a state of mind where we are not intellectually thinking about melody, we are hearing it.

Conversational Verse Melody A verse melody with a small note range of two to four notes. Even though it is sung, it gives the illusion of simply talking to the listener, a great device for setting up a big emotional chorus.

Hooky. In songwriter lingo, the part of a song that causes the human ear and brain to get caught by certain melody patterns and repetitions, like a fish biting down on a hook.

Hotspot. A naturally occurring consequence of melody, a part of a melodic line that draws the listener in like a moth to a flame.

Inspired Listening Listening to music without judgment while focusing on elements that inspire and which can be incorporated into your own writing. It promotes growth of the writer.

It is the opposite of reactive listening which revolves around judgment and opinions. This simply reinforces what you think you already know.

Line plus, line plus three, etc. A system of melodic pattern writing that makes songs hookier and grabs the listener's attention. A way of understanding melody phrases by breaking them down into smaller parts containing fluid lines and rhythmic patterns.

Common variations are line plus three, three plus line, and line plus two. The PRA method. An approach to melody composition utilizing three core elements of songwriting.

Pattern, repetition, and arc.

Pro feedback. A faster way to improve writing by seeking critiques on your songs from pro writers who have achieved success in their field. Organizations like songtown.com match aspiring writers with pros for song feedback.

Repeated interval jumps. Jumping back and forth between two notes that are separated by more than a whole step. A technique used in all genres.

Shapeshifting. When a melodic pattern is repeated higher or lower in the scale. In other words, take a melodic shape and move the entire shape higher or lower on the scale.

The relationship between the notes usually stays the same, but the pattern starts on a different note, perhaps a few notes lower or higher than the first pattern.

Spitballing The technique of improvising vocal melodies without the aid of forethought or words. The Talk-Sing Method A method of practicing that develops quick reflexes for hearing words and emotion and then turning them into melody.

It involves hearing words spoken in a conversation and immediately singing them without forethought. Topliner Topliners work with a track person by adding melody and lyrics on top of the musical track.

Track guy, girl, person. Someone who creates music tracks or a groove under the lyrics and melody of a song using a combination of computer, loops, and live instruments.

Word painting. A device of imitating the emotion, action, or natural sounds as described in the lyrical text. It is the art of bringing a word to life by mirroring its meaning with music and or melody.
