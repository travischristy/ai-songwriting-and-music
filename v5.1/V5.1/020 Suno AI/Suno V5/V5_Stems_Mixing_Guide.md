# Suno v5 — Stems & Mixing Quick Fixes

## 1) Quick Diagnosis
- **Bass-heavy / muddy?** Low end masks clarity; check kick vs. bass overlap.
- **Dull top-end?** Add gentle high-shelf; avoid harshness >10 kHz.
- **Crowded midrange?** Narrow 200–500 Hz and 2–4 kHz hotspots.

## 2) Fast EQ Fixes
- **Kick/Bass separation**: High-pass non-bass instruments at 80–120 Hz.  
- **Tame mud**: -2 to -3 dB wide cut around 200–350 Hz on master (or buses).  
- **Add air**: +1 to +2 dB high-shelf at 8–10 kHz on master.  
- **De-ess**: 5–8 kHz band on vocal bus if sibilant.

## 3) Dynamics
- **Glue comp** (mix bus): 2:1, slow attack, medium release, 1–2 dB GR.  
- **Multiband** (optional): tame 60–120 Hz if boomy; gentle ratio (1.5–2:1).

## 4) Loudness Targets
- Streaming-safe: **-14 to -9 LUFS integrated**, **-1.0 dBTP** ceiling.
- Dance/club: **-8 to -6 LUFS** with care to avoid pumping.

## 5) Stems Workflow
1. Export stems (drums, bass, guitars/synths, vocals, FX).  
2. Balance bass vs. kick first; leave 4–6 dB headroom.  
3. Brighten vocals slightly; keep reverb modest for clarity.  
4. Finalize on master with subtle EQ + limiter (don’t chase loudness).

## 6) Export Presets
- **WAV 24-bit, 48 kHz**, -1.0 dBTP ceiling.  
- MP3 320 kbps (distribution-ready preview).

## 7) Troubleshooting
- **Extend artifacts**: crossfade or re-generate the handoff section.  
- **Genre drift (extreme tempos)**: reassert BPM and groove in prompt; try shorter forms.
