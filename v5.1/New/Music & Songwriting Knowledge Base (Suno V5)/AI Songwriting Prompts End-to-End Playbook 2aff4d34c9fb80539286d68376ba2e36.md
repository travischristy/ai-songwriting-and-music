# AI Songwriting Prompts: End-to-End Playbook

---

This collection distills AI-powered songwriting into a clear, end-to-end playbook, from shaping voice and imagery to drafting, production direction, and rigorous revision. Each prompt is purpose-built to spark originality, control energy and arrangement, and ensure prosodic, lyrical, and genre authenticity—so ideas move reliably from concept to compelling, production-ready songs.

## Phase I: Ideation & Conceptualization (The Human Core)

These prompts guide the AI to help the user establish the thematic foundation, personal voice, and structural map before writing lyrics, aligning with the "12 Questions for Song Writers" process.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Defining Voice and Theme** | "Analyze my provided values [e.g., honesty, resilience, quiet melancholy]. Suggest three core themes that reflect these values and generate a unique philosophical statement (Worldview) for a song that aims to create a deep connection with the listener (Audience-Centric Focus)." | The unique values and beliefs held by the writer guide the creative process. |
| **2. Mapping the Narrative Arc** | "I want to write a song using the **Time Zones Song Map** structure. The 'now' (Vantage Point) is: [e.g., realizing the relationship is over]. Outline a narrative blueprint (Song Blueprint) that details **what** should be communicated in Verse 1 (Past), Verse 2 (Present), and the Bridge (Future/Twist)." | A systematic pre-writing process ensures logical and progressive narrative flow. |
| **3. Generating Core Imagery** | "I need strong, concrete imagery for a song about [e.g., profound loneliness]. Generate 10 pieces of unique **'Song Furniture'** (sensory details) related to this theme that appeal to **sight and sound**. Do not use clichés or abstract nouns like 'sadness'." | The "Show, Don't Tell" mandate grounds abstract emotions in specific, memorable sensory details. |

## Phase II: Drafting & Lyrical Craft (The What)

These prompts leverage AI to generate high-quality, non-generic lyrics or structure basic ideas, incorporating advanced rhetorical techniques in a straightforward way.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **4. Generating Unique Metaphor** | "I am stuck describing [Concept: e.g., feeling trapped]. Use the **Dalí's Paranoiac-Critical Method** to view this concept through an unrelated, physical lens: [Object: e.g., an abandoned traffic light]. Generate four evocative lines of metaphorical imagery based on this fusion." | Intentional constraint and systematic misinterpretation force unique, non-clichéd metaphor generation (Conceptual Arbitrage). |
| **5. Creating a Witty Hook** | "Generate three alternative phrases for a chorus that uses **layered meaning** or **witty wordplay** on the polysemous word [Word: e.g., 'trust']. The goal is to create dense, clever lyricism suitable for a catchy hook." | Utilizing polysemy (words with multiple meanings) through **Antanaclasis** creates wit and intellectual depth. |
| **6. Overcoming Writer's Block** | "I have an existing text/prose piece describing my song's theme: [Insert text]. Apply the **Cut-Up Technique** by fragmenting this text and randomly recombining the pieces. Present the four most surprising or evocative resulting phrases to use as new starting lines." | The Cut-Up Technique breaks habitual thought patterns and ignites inspiration by introducing random juxtapositions. |

## Phase III: Production & Style Configuration (The How)

These prompts focus on generating the precise instructions necessary for a music generator (like Suno) to produce a coherent, professionally arranged track. The human acts as the "discerning director".

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **7. Narrating the Energy Curve** | "I need a single, descriptive **Style of Music Prompt** for an [e.g., epic orchestral pop] track. Narrate the song's energy (Arrangement) across its structure: **Verse 1** must be sparse and build tension slowly, the **Pre-Chorus** must incorporate a rhythmic increase (crescendo), and the **Chorus** must deliver a cathartic, layered release (high hype)." | The prompt should narrate the desired evolution chronologically, describing the instrumental density to control the perceived energy curve. |
| **8. Emulating a Genre Style** | "Generate a Style Prompt that captures the essence of [e.g., 90s Grunge with Hip-Hop drums]. Describe the core elements: **Guitar Sound** (e.g., heavily distorted, drop tuning), **Vocal Delivery** (e.g., angst-ridden male baritone), and **Drum/Rhythm** (e.g., Roland TR-808 beat). **EXCLUDE:** No acoustic piano." | Deconstruction requires translating abstract artist styles into concrete descriptors and leveraging negative constraints. |
| **9. Adding Micro-Level Performance Control** | "Take my existing raw lyrics: [Insert Lyrics]. Now, annotate them with **Metatags** (Layer 2 commands) that: 1. Clearly mark the structure ([Verse], [Chorus]). 2. Add dynamic instruction ([Crescendo], [Quietly]). 3. Use **ALL CAPS** to cue a powerful, belting vocal delivery on the climax line." | Lyrical metatags act as explicit stage directions to the AI, giving the songwriter granular control over performance and structure. |
| **10. Forcing Idiomatic Instrumentation** | "I am writing a melancholy Country song about loneliness. Generate a Style Prompt that maximizes the use of instruments that function as **Sonic Signifiers** of this theme. Ensure the main melody utilizes the 'weeping' sound of the **Pedal Steel Guitar**." | AI must understand cultural associations (cultural signifiers) and idiomatic traits of instruments to ensure authenticity and emotional congruence. |

## Phase IV: Revision & Quality Control (The Critique)

These prompts leverage AI's analytical and pattern-breaking capabilities to critique drafts, ensuring structural fidelity, prosodic alignment, and originality.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **11. Structural and Rhythmic Check** | "Analyze the following lyrics [Insert Draft Verse] against a 4/4 meter. Score the **Prosodic Alignment** by identifying any natural **lyrical stress**that falls on a weak musical beat. Suggest rewrites that prioritize **conversational syntax** and clear prosody." | **Prosodic Alignment** is critical for making words sound natural and memorable by matching speech rhythm to music rhythm. |
| **12. Challenging Mediocrity** | "Take my completed song draft. Apply a **Creative Sabotage Inversion Rule**: Rewrite the Bridge section so that its primary emotional arc is the literal opposite of the rest of the song (e.g., if the song is sad, make the Bridge aggressively triumphant). The goal is to force innovation and break predictable patterns." | Intentional pattern-breaking or imposing constraints (Creative Sabotage) is a powerful method for forcing novel solutions and avoiding predictable output. |
| **13. Diagnosing Emotional Mismatch** | "I generated a musical track using the style prompt: [Upbeat, Major-Key 80s Pop]. However, the lyrics [Insert Verse] feel dull. Analyze the lyrics for **Lyrical-Musical Incongruity**. Suggest adjustments to the lyrical **Register** or vocabulary to match the song's energetic, positive mood, ensuring authenticity for the genre." | Lyrical and musical elements must align in emotional valence; incongruity results in confusing or "lukewarm" songwriting. |
| **14. Automated Quality Scan** | "Scan the following lyrical passage: [Insert Lyrics]. Use the **Cliché Guardrail™** feature to identify all overused phrases or predictable rhymes. For each identified cliché (e.g., 'fire/desire'), provide three fresh, specific alternatives that maintain the same line length/syllable count." | The AI must actively filter out content that is unoriginal, as clichés lose their emotional potency and signal a lack of depth. |

## Deep Analysis and Strategic Emulation (The Auteur's Blueprint)

These tasks direct the AI to analyze established hits or artistic styles, translating complex musical and lyrical structures into reusable blueprints, constraints, and specific creative parameters.

### A. Deconstruction and Blueprint Generation (The "Song Tracing" Workflow)

These prompts ask the AI to reverse-engineer a reference song, turning it into a formula the user can apply to a new composition.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Analyzing Macro-Structure** | "Analyze the full lyrics and suggested music of [Song Title] by [Artist]. Generate a precise **Song Blueprint** (JSON or Outline) that identifies the function of each section (Verse 1, Chorus, Bridge), the relative **Hype Level** (energy/density), and the method used to establish the main melodic theme. | Song Blueprinting defines *what* to communicate in each section; a bad arrangement will sabotage a song's energy. Repetition helps clarify the song's anchor point. |
| **2. Extracting Narrative Flow** | "Deconstruct the story of [Reference Song Title]. Outline the narrative progression using the **Time Zones** framework (or **Problem/Declaration**). Specify what concrete, specific imagery (**Song Furniture**) is used in the Verse to set the scene (low hype) versus the generalized emotion used in the Chorus (high hype). | Song Mapping transforms a lyrical concept into a 3D narrative with a clear arc. Verses use specificity, while choruses use generality. |
| **3. Reverse-Engineering Instrumentation** | "Analyze the arrangement of [Reference Song] (Layer 1 deconstruction). Detail the **Instrumental Layers** and **Playing Style Descriptors**. Identify the **Sonic Signifier** (e.g., Pedal Steel Guitar, TR-808) that defines the genre's mood, and detail its specific role (Part Writing) in the Chorus. | Deconstruction requires breaking sound into communicable components. Specific instrument names yield precise results. |
| **4. Generating a Reusable Template** | "Based on the comprehensive analysis of [Reference Song]’s structure and lyrical flow, generate a **Reusable Template** for a new song, specifying the recommended line count, ideal rhythmic cadence, and thematic function for each section (Verse, Chorus, Bridge). | Turning analysis into a template minimizes friction in future drafts, ensuring structure is built purposefully. |

### B. Intentional Emulation and Auteurship (Steal the Thinking)

These prompts instruct the AI to emulate the underlying generative principles of master songwriters or specific genre conventions, allowing the user to strategically borrow techniques.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **5. Emulating an Auteur's Voice** | "I am writing a song about [Theme, e.g., urban alienation]. Generate a four-line verse using the principles of the **Tom Waits Model**. Ensure the language uses an **Embodied Persona** perspective with a Linguistic Fingerprint that prioritizes first-person narrative and evocative, perplexing imagery." | Lyrical Auteurship models provide concrete, reverse-engineered frameworks of a master writer's voice, moving beyond simple mimicry. |
| **6. Synthesizing Ambiguity** | "Generate a chorus about profound personal devotion. Apply the **Leonard Cohen Model**, setting the **ambiguity_level** to 0.8. The lyrics must actively fuse imagery tagged with **sacred** and **profane** concepts to resist a single, definitive interpretation. | Cohen's core mechanic resists a single interpretation, using deliberate ambiguity to invite listener engagement. |
| **7. Achieving Genre Authenticity** | "Analyze the conventions and tropes of [Genre, e.g., Country Ballad]. Generate a style prompt that uses **genre-specific prosody** and incorporates lyrical conventions that are perceived as 'authentic' in this genre, but ensures the final production prompt **EXCLUDES** the use of obvious clichés. | Authenticity requires modulating adherence to tropes based on genre; AI must know when to use conventions skillfully. |

### C. Advanced Analytical Audits (The Critique)

These prompts use advanced, quantifiable frameworks to critique a reference song (or the user’s own draft) in preparation for revision.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **8. Quantifying Emotional Journey (ITPRA)** | "Analyze the chord progression and melodic contour of the Chorus section in [Reference Song]. Describe how it utilizes the **Huron ITPRA Model** by managing the listener's expectation. Specifically, explain how the final melodic phrase creates a **Prediction Response** (catharsis/closure) by resolving a high-tension motif. | The ITPRA Model provides a procedural tool for constructing melodies that manage a listener's cycle of tension and reward. |
| **9. Diagnosing Structural Flaws** | "Analyze my current draft's Verse 2. Calculate its **Prosodic Alignment**score by comparing lyrical stress against a 4/4 meter. Identify the line with the worst alignment and suggest a rewrite that ensures the natural syllabic stress aligns with the strong musical accents." | Failure in prosody (misalignment of stress) makes lyrics feel awkward and unmemorable, requiring targeted correction. |
| **10. Testing Consistency (Persona Congruence)** | "Analyze the provided lyric [Insert Line] against the **Kendrick Lamar Model** Persona Profile. Calculate the line's **stylistic congruence score**. If the score is low, explain which element—vocabulary, thematic register, or rhythmic cadence—causes the incongruence with the established persona." | Fine-tuning models on an artist's discography allows for testing a new lyric's perplexity against the established "persona". |

### D. Creative Fusion and Pattern Breaking (Conceptual Arbitrage)

These prompts command the AI to intentionally combine disparate elements or break existing patterns to generate novel, surprising, or highly original outputs.

| Goal | Broadly Adaptable AI Prompt | Source Principle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **11. Genre Fusion for Style Prompt** | "Perform **Conceptual Arbitrage** by fusing the sonic aesthetics of [Cultural Package A: e.g., Parisian 1890s Cabaret] with the thematic elements of [Cultural Package B: e.g., Modern Urbanism/Industrial Music]. Generate a **Style Prompt** that explicitly fuses a traditional instrument (detuned piano) with a modern signifier of urbanism (Roland TR-808 drum machine). | Conceptual Arbitrage is the intentional fusion of disparate aesthetics, creating novel artistic hybrids based on deep contextual knowledge. |
| **12. Melodic Pattern Disruption** | "I have a completed Chorus melody. Apply the **Creative Sabotage: Substitution Rule** by rewriting the melody so that the original melodic instrument (e.g., distorted guitar) is replaced with an instrument from a maximally contrasting genre (e.g., classical harp). Describe the resulting mood change." | Creative Sabotage rules are constraints used to intentionally disrupt patterns to force novel solutions. |
| **13. Lyrical Metaphor Fusion** | "I want to describe [Concept: e.g., the pressure of time] using a metaphor. Apply **Dalí's Paranoiac-Critical Method** by forcing the description through the lens of [Object: e.g., a broken vending machine]. Generate three lines of surreal, evocative imagery based on this systematic misinterpretation." | The method forces irrational links between unrelated objects to generate original, non-cliché, dream-like imagery. |
