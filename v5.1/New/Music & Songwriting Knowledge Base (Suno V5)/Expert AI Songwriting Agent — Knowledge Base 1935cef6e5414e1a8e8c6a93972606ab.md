## Expert AI Songwriting Agent — Knowledge Base (Expanded)

---

## 1) Mindset and Unblocking

- What it is
    - A professional framework that prioritizes listener impact, deliberate practice, and prolific output over waiting for inspiration.[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
- Why it matters
    - Quantity begets quality when craft is iterative
    - Process focus reduces perfection paralysis
    - Audience-centric choices sharpen lyrical and structural decisions[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
- How to do it (checklist)
    - Set a daily writing window and a target count (e.g., 2 choruses + 1 verse)
    - Apply “Dare to suck”: capture first drafts fast, evaluate later
    - Use a “subject pivot” when energy drops; switch topic or angle
- Micro-examples
    - Bad: “I’m sad” → Better: “Coffee for two goes cold by the window” (scene detail)
    - Bad: “You left me” → Better: “Your denim jacket on the chair back, untouched”[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
- Failure modes and fixes
    - Vague abstractions → swap for objects, places, actions (“song furniture”)[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
    - Over-editing mid-draft → enforce Flow vs Edit phases
    - Recycled tropes → consult cliché table (see Lyrics Craft)
- Suno application
    - Style prompt stays concise; the detail lives in lyrics
    - [Metatag] seed for momentum: [Verse: Storytelling, sparse]
- Cross-references: Flow vs Edit, Lyrics Craft, Suno Optimization
- Notes: favor actions and objects to externalize emotion[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)

---

## 2) Flow vs Edit Playbook

- What it is
    - Two distinct operating modes for ideation (Flow) and constraint (Edit)
- Why it matters
    - Mixing modes causes self-censorship and thin output
- How to do it
    - Flow: temperature high, 3–5 options per section, zero critique
    - Edit: temperature low, enforce prosody, POV, structure, imagery density
- Micro-examples
    - Flow draft chorus (raw): “Radio on, open road, I’m gone…” → Edit: align stresses, place hook on downbeat
- Failure modes and fixes
    - Phase slip (critiquing in Flow) → set 10‑minute timer, ban backspace
    - Rule amnesia in Edit → run prosody scan and cliché check
- Suno application
    - Flow pass yields options; Edit pass formats with [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus] and performance tags
- Cross-references: Prosody tests, Suno syntax[[2]](A%20Technical%20Analysis%20of%20Lyrical%20Syntax%20and%20Command%20278f4d34c9fb819492cfef4ac28ec99b.md)

## 3) Structure Reference

- What it is
    - Working forms with “use when,” bar-count tendencies, and contrast tactics
- Why it matters
    - Form dictates energy curve and listener expectation
- How to do it (quick cards)
    - Verse–Chorus (AB): Use for hook-forward songs; add Pre‑Chorus for lift; bar norms: 8–8–8; Contrast: “save the I” (avoid tonic in verse, land I at chorus)[[3]](Reference%20Sheet_%20Song%20Sections%20and%20Structures%20by%20G%20278f4d34c9fb8165a492e08aa95e173f.md)
    - Verse–Refrain: Narrative-forward; refrain anchors theme when a full chorus feels too big[[3]](Reference%20Sheet_%20Song%20Sections%20and%20Structures%20by%20G%20278f4d34c9fb8165a492e08aa95e173f.md)[[4]](Exploring%20Less%20Common%20Song%20Sections%20and%20Structures%20278f4d34c9fb81018127ce3f633cff90.md)
    - AABA (32‑bar): Strong verse melody; bridge supplies sole large contrast; solos often replace final A[[3]](Reference%20Sheet_%20Song%20Sections%20and%20Structures%20by%20G%20278f4d34c9fb8165a492e08aa95e173f.md)
    - 12‑Bar Blues (AAB): Cyclic, lyric AAB over I–IV–V; use for groove/feel priority[[3]](Reference%20Sheet_%20Song%20Sections%20and%20Structures%20by%20G%20278f4d34c9fb8165a492e08aa95e173f.md)
- Micro-examples (contrast tactics)
    - Lift to chorus: increase chord-change frequency + widen texture + introduce kick pattern[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Placement-and-Effect-of-Common-Musical-Devices-278f4d34c9fb814093d8d74ec593fa91?pvs=21)
- Failure modes and fixes
    - Flat chorus → “save the I,” add build tag, raise contour[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Placement-and-Effect-of-Common-Musical-Devices-278f4d34c9fb814093d8d74ec593fa91?pvs=21)
- Suno application
    - Tags: [Verse] → [Pre‑Chorus: Building Intensity] → [Chorus: Catchy Hook][[6]](suno-metatags-cheatsheet%20278f4d34c9fb8109bd93e97de0615bcf.md)
- Cross-references: Energy devices, Suno cookbook

## 4) Lyrics Craft

- What it is
    - Prosody, imagery, POV, and anti‑cliché systems for singable, vivid lyrics
- Why it matters
    - Prosodic mismatch breaks immersion; abstractions weaken hooks
- How to do it
    - Prosody tests: speak line naturally → mark stresses → align stressed syllables to strong beats
    - “Song furniture”: locations, objects, actions, times, colors in each verse[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
    - POV and vantage “now”: declare narrator and time anchor per section
- Cliché blocker (HIGH/EXTREME tokens → 3 sensory swaps)
    - shadows → streetlight halo on wet asphalt • echo → store stairwell slap • ignite → pilot light clicks[[7]](Cliches%20and%20Overused%20Words%20Master%20Database%20280f4d34c9fb810cbaa9eebc84442502.md)
- Micro-examples
    - Abstract: “I’m breaking inside” → Concrete: “Bills spread on the stove, red stamps facing up”
- Failure modes and fixes
    - Yoda syntax to force rhyme → rewrite for speech prosody
    - Title buried → place in power positions (first/last line of chorus)[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
- Suno application
    - Keep style prompt lean; put detail in lyric lines with metered, singable lengths
- Cross-references: Prosody syntax, Suno syntax[[2]](A%20Technical%20Analysis%20of%20Lyrical%20Syntax%20and%20Command%20278f4d34c9fb819492cfef4ac28ec99b.md)

## 5) Harmony, Melody, Rhythm Levers

- What it is
    - Practical knobs for energy and memorability
- Why it matters
    - Small lever moves can rescue “flat” sections
- How to do it
    - Harmony: increase chord-change frequency for lift; use dominant → tonic arrival at chorus; modal color for surprise[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Placement-and-Effect-of-Common-Musical-Devices-278f4d34c9fb814093d8d74ec593fa91?pvs=21)
    - Melody: apply the Line Plus family to create hooks; shape wider chorus contour than verse[[8]](Line-Plus-Technique%20278f4d34c9fb81cb92d7f0226fefecc0.md)
    - Rhythm: add or remove subdivision; deploy syncopation and stop‑time for tension/release[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Placement-and-Effect-of-Common-Musical-Devices-278f4d34c9fb814093d8d74ec593fa91?pvs=21)
- Micro-examples
    - Chorus lift: pre‑chorus ends on V → chorus bar 1 lands I, add upper‑register leap
- Failure modes and fixes
    - Monotone topline → introduce motif then vary contour (narrow→wide)[[8]](Line-Plus-Technique%20278f4d34c9fb81cb92d7f0226fefecc0.md)[[9]](The%20P%20Method%20Pattern,%20Repetition,%20and%20Arc%20278f4d34c9fb8113a099cb7ccf96960e.md)
- Suno application
    - [Build], [Crescendo], [Stripped Back], [Break] around chorus to program hype curve[[6]](suno-metatags-cheatsheet%20278f4d34c9fb8109bd93e97de0615bcf.md)

## 6) Advanced Literary Devices

- What it is
    - Aporia (productive doubt), antanaclasis (same word, new meaning), chiasmus (AB:BA)
- Why it matters
    - Depth and memorability without verbosity
- How to do it (micro)
    - Aporia: “What if I turn the light and you’re still gone?”
    - Antanaclasis: “I need a break before the break hits back”
    - Chiasmus: “We kept the time, then time kept us”
- Failure modes and fixes
    - Overuse → 1 device per section max; read aloud for clarity
- Suno application
    - Keep devices in lyrics; avoid stuffing style prompt

## 7) Sonic Signifiers Encyclopedia (starter set)

- TR‑808: booming sine kick, long decay → urbanism, synthetic minimalism → use for tech/urban themes; example line: “Streetlights pump in 16ths, heart on grid”
- Pedal Steel: gliding bends, “weeping” sustain → Americana, vastness → “Moonfields bending under steel”[[1]](Songwriting%20Knowledge%20Base%20Overview%2027ff4d34c9fb8096baf4d2a97eb02fd3.md)
- Add 10–15 more entries as corpus grows

## 12) Troubleshooting Recipes

- Chorus lacks lift → Likely: tonic landed early, texture static → Fix: “save the I,” add build tag, widen spectrum, leap contour[[5]](https://www.notion.so/Placement-and-Effect-of-Common-Musical-Devices-278f4d34c9fb814093d8d74ec593fa91?pvs=21)
