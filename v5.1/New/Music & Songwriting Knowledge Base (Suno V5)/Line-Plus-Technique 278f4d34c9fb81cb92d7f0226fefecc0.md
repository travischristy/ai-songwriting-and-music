# Line Plus Technique - A Songwriting Technique for Hookier Songs

**The Core Principle: Pattern and Repetition**

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of each variation, it’s crucial to understand the underlying principle: *pattern recognition*. Our brains are wired to seek out patterns. When we encounter a recognizable rhythmic or melodic pattern, especially one that repeats, it becomes “hooky” – it sticks in our minds. The “line plus” techniques exploit this tendency by creating a sense of familiarity and anticipation, making the song more memorable. The use of these patterns gives the song structure and helps make sections distinctive.

**Diving Deep into the Variations**

Let’s revisit each of the line plus variations, this time with a more granular level of detail.

**1. Line Plus Three**

- **Detailed Mechanism:** As mentioned previously, this variation combines a melodic line (which can be of varying lengths) with a repeating three-note pattern at the end of that line. The three-note pattern is frequently (but not always) a *triplet*. A triplet is a rhythmic pattern where three notes are played in the space of two notes of the same value. For example, three eighth notes are played in the time normally taken up by two eighth notes. This creates a distinctive feel, a little faster and more fluid than the surrounding rhythm. The three notes can all be on the same pitch, or they might ascend, descend, or follow a more complex melodic contour. They might all be the same duration, or they might be more varied. The key is that the three notes form a recognizable *rhythmic* unit. In addition, the three notes can be all of the same syllable, or they can each have its own syllable.
- **Rules:**
    - **Placement:** Typically, this pattern comes at the end of a lyrical line. However, creative songwriters sometimes place it at the beginning or even within the middle of a line.
    - **Rhythm:** The triplet feel is a common characteristic but not a requirement. You can use other subdivisions to create a three-note feel that’s not a triplet, or you can use a pattern that has a mixture of subdivisions of the beat. The important thing is that the three-note rhythmic feel is noticeable.
    - **Melody:** The three notes can be the same or different pitches. What’s more important is that they form a distinct melodic shape in combination with the rhythmic feel.
    - **Emphasis:** The three-note pattern can be emphasized through various techniques: rhythmic emphasis (making the three notes louder), melodic emphasis (giving the three notes a unique melodic shape), or lyrical emphasis (using rhyming or alliterative words).
- **Identifying Existing Examples:** Listen carefully to the end of melodic phrases. You might need to tap the rhythm out with your hand to clearly identify the three-note feel, as sometimes it can be disguised by other musical elements. Also, pay attention to the lyrics. If the three notes at the end of a line use rhyming words or repeated syllables, that’s a good indication of line plus three. Also, pay attention to *how* the notes are sung. Are they more clipped, or legato? Is the pitch the same, or does it change?.
- **Creating Your Own:**
    1. **Start with a line:** Come up with a melody and lyrics for a line that you feel has an emotional impact.
    2. **Add the three notes:** At the end of the line, add three notes. They can be the same pitch or follow a melody. Experiment with rhythmic variations, and be sure that they stand out from the rest of the line and create a hook.
    3. **Emphasize:** Choose words for the three notes that have impact: descriptive words, emotional words, or words that rhyme with each other.
    4. **Refine:** Listen carefully to how the line feels. Does it feel natural? Does the three note section feel satisfying? Does it contribute to the emotion of the song?.
- **Example Breakdown:**
    - **Rick Astley - “Never Gonna Give You Up”:** As we said before, the chorus is a textbook example: “Never gonna **give you up**,” “Never gonna **let you down**,” “Never gonna run around and **desert you**.” The three notes in bold are rhythmically similar triplets, although not identical in melody or vowel sounds.
    - **NF - “Let You Down”:** Notice the rhyming words at the end of each line that use a triplet rhythm: “Edge right now,” “say I’m proud,” “let you down,” “let you down.” “Head get loud,” “shut them out,” “let you down,” “let you down.”
    - **Post Malone - “Better Now”:** The three-note repetition at the end of each phrase is more rhythmic and less melodic, using the same two syllables in each case: “Better now, **better now**. Not around, **not around**. Let you down, **let you down**.”

**2. Three Plus Line**

- **Detailed Mechanism:** This is the inverse of line plus three. Here, a three-note pattern begins the melodic line, followed by the rest of the phrase. The three-note pattern is still a recognizable rhythmic unit and often features the triplet feel, but its position at the start of the line creates a different effect. It sets the rhythmic and melodic tone for the rest of the line, creating a sense of anticipation or momentum. This technique can be used to grab the listener’s attention immediately. As in line plus three, the notes can be any pitch, but they should stand out from the rest of the line rhythmically and melodically.
- **Rules:**
    - **Placement:** Always at the beginning of the line, before the rest of the lyrical and melodic information.
    - **Rhythm:** Similar to line plus three, the three notes often have a triplet feel.
    - **Melody:** The three notes can be the same or different pitches, but they must form a distinct melodic and rhythmic unit.
    - **Contrast:** The three-note section should contrast with the rest of the line. It might use shorter note durations, fewer syllables, or a different melodic shape.
- **Identifying Existing Examples:** Listen for lines that begin with a clear three-note rhythmic pattern. Unlike line plus three, it will be at the *beginning* of the line.
- **Creating Your Own:**
    1. **Start with three notes:** Create a rhythmically compelling three-note pattern.
    2. **Add the line:** Follow this pattern with your melody and lyrics.
    3. **Contrast:** Ensure the three notes contrast rhythmically and melodically with the rest of the line.
    4. **Emphasize:** Use descriptive or important words in the three-note section to make it more memorable.
- **Example Breakdown:**
    - **Thomas Rhett - “Unforgettable”:** In the chorus, the three plus line pattern is immediately noticeable: “**That mango** you were drinking, **that Coldplay** song that you were singing.” Note the three-syllable phrases at the beginning of the line, as well as the descriptive words used in that section. Also, notice that the three-syllable pattern is set to the same rhythm and melody at the start of each line.
    - **Darius Rucker - “History in the Making”:** The chorus starts every line with the three plus pattern: “This could be **memories** baby this **last first** kiss.” Again, notice that each of the three-syllable phrases at the start of each line follow the same rhythm and melody.

**3. Line Plus Two**

- **Detailed Mechanism:** This variation uses a two-syllable pattern at the beginning or end of a melodic line. Unlike the previous patterns, the rhythmic feel is not quite as important as the sonic similarity of the two syllables. They are typically near rhymes, meaning they have similar but not identical vowel sounds. They may have a different consonant or a slightly different pitch. The two syllables can either come at the end or the beginning of the line.
- **Rules:**
    - **Placement:** Usually at the beginning or end of a phrase, but sometimes it can be both.
    - **Near Rhyme:** The two syllables should have a similar sonic quality (a near rhyme).
    - **Melody:** The melody and rhythm should complement the near rhyme, making it stand out.
- **Identifying Existing Examples:** Listen for lines where a pair of syllables with a rhyming feel are used in quick succession.
- **Creating Your Own:**
    1. **Choose a rhyme:** Select a near rhyme that you want to use. It could be the title of your song.
    2. **Place it:** Use it at the beginning or end of a melodic line.
    3. **Vary placement**: Use it at the end of one line, and the beginning of the next.
    4. **Enhance:** Use other elements of repetition, such as melody or rhythm to emphasize the phrase.
- **Example Breakdown:**
    - **Little Big Town - “Girl Crush”:** The first two phrases of the song use line plus two: “**Girl crush**, **heart rush**,”. Note that the two syllables are near rhymes, and that they create a kind of musical phrase.
    - **Dan and Shay - “Speechless”:** Many of the lines in this song begin with a two-syllable near rhyme: “**Speechless**, **that dress**, **secret**, **weakness**, **nervous**.”

**4. Two Plus Line**

- **Detailed Mechanism:** In this variation, the two rhyming syllables come at the very beginning of the melodic line. This is similar to line plus two except for the location of the two syllables: now they are at the start of the phrase rather than at the end.
- **Rules:**
    - **Placement:** The two rhyming syllables must come at the beginning of the line.
    - **Near Rhyme:** As with line plus two, the two syllables should have similar sonic qualities.
    - **Emphasis:** Use a melody or rhythm that emphasizes the two-syllable pattern.
- **Identifying Existing Examples:** Look for a short, two-syllable near rhyme at the beginning of a line.
- **Creating Your Own:**
    1. **Start with two:** Choose a compelling near rhyme to start the line.
    2. **Add the line:** Then, add your melody and lyrics for the remainder of the phrase.
- **Example Breakdown:**
    - **Dustin Lynch - “Good Girl”:** The title of the song, and the first two words, demonstrate this pattern: “**Good girl**, whole world.”

**5. One Plus Line**

- **Detailed Mechanism:** This is a less common variation that uses a single stressed syllable to begin a series of lines. The single syllable provides a rhythmic and sonic anchor for the subsequent lines. It creates a unique and surprising sound, and sets up a predictable pattern that makes the subsequent lines that follow it stand out.
- **Rules:**
    - **Placement:** The one-syllable word is typically at the beginning of a line.
    - **Repetition:** It may be followed by a series of lines that use a similar rhythm, increasing in the number of syllables in each line, for example.
    - **Contrast**: The one-syllable word stands out due to its brevity. It is usually followed by longer phrases.
- **Identifying Existing Examples:** This is a less common technique, so you might have to listen more carefully to identify it.
- **Creating Your Own:**
    1. **Choose one:** Select a strong one-syllable word.
    2. **Build a sequence:** Follow it with lines that increase in length, syllable count, or rhythmic complexity.
- **Example Breakdown:**
    - **Dua Lipa - “New Rules”:** The song starts the chorus with the word “one”, and then subsequent chorus lines with two and three syllables to hook the listener.

**Beyond the Basic Variations**

It’s important to note that “line plus” is not limited to these five variations. You can experiment with four-note patterns (line plus four), five-note patterns (line plus five), variations on three plus three, and many other combinations. The key is to create a distinct, repeating pattern that hooks the listener.

**Why “Line Plus” Works: The Science of Hooks**

- **Pattern Recognition:** As I mentioned at the beginning, our brains love patterns. When you use a “line plus” technique, you’re essentially giving the listener’s brain a pattern to latch onto. This pattern becomes predictable and comfortable, making the song memorable.
- **Anticipation:** The repeating pattern creates anticipation. The listener knows what’s coming, and they look forward to it. This anticipation is satisfying when the pattern is repeated.
- **Rhythmic Drive:** The added notes provide a rhythmic push, making the song more energetic and engaging.
- **Emphasis:** The “plus” section is a great place to highlight important words in your lyrics. The repetition and distinctive sound make these words stand out.
- **Emotional Impact:** The rhythmic and melodic choices in a “line plus” section can enhance the emotional feel of your song.

**Practice Makes Perfect**

Here are some exercises to help you master “line plus”:

1. **Active Listening:** Listen to a variety of songs and try to identify the different “line plus” variations. Tap out the rhythms, sing the melodies, and pay attention to the lyrics. Create a playlist of “line plus” songs. Notice where the songwriter chose to place the line plus pattern. What effect does the placement have on your experience as a listener?.
2. **Rewriting:** Choose some of your old songs and try rewriting them using different “line plus” techniques. This will help you see how these patterns can transform a song. Rewrite famous songs that don’t use line plus to get practice using this technique.
3. **Tapping:** Start with a rhythm. Tap out a rhythm pattern, and then end with a plus three. Then add melody. Then add lyrics. Try this same technique with all the variations.
4. **Experimentation:** Try all the different variations of line plus. Try them in different parts of a song. Mix different variations of line plus within the same song.
5. **Co-writing:** Write a song with another writer who already uses the line plus technique intuitively. Or introduce this technique to someone who has never heard of it before.

**Moving Forward**

The “line plus” techniques offer a powerful and versatile approach to songwriting. They provide a way to create memorable hooks, emphasize important lyrics, and generate a sense of momentum. By learning to identify and implement these techniques, you can greatly enhance your songwriting skills.

## Implementation by Song Section

### Chorus Implementation

The chorus is the most critical place to use Line Plus, as it creates the song’s primary hook.

**Guidelines:**

1. Use Line Plus Three in the first and last lines of chorus
2. Maintain consistent placement in parallel lines
3. Consider repeating the exact same Line Plus pattern for maximum memorability
4. Place the title or key message within the Line Plus pattern

**Example Structure:**

```
I'm riding high on the rhythm tonight (on-the-rhythm)
Nothing can stop this feeling inside
Every move synchronized just right (syn-chronized)
Taking control of the floor tonight (of-the-floor)
```

### Verse Implementation

In verses, Line Plus can create anticipation for the chorus and establish rhythmic patterns.

**Guidelines:**

1. Use Line Plus more sparingly than in chorus
2. Place at end of key narrative points
3. Create contrast with chorus by using different Line Plus patterns
4. Consider using Line Plus to emphasize rhyme scheme

**Example Structure:**

```
Walking down the avenue at dawn (av-e-nue)
People moving quickly past my view
Coffee shops are opening their doors (op-en-ing)
As the city slowly comes alive
```

### Bridge Implementation

In bridges, Line Plus can highlight contrasting ideas or emotional shifts.

**Guidelines:**

1. Use different Line Plus pattern than verse/chorus
2. Place at emotional high points
3. Consider using to emphasize key realizations
4. Create transitional momentum back to chorus

**Example Structure:**

```
Everything I thought I knew before (thought-I-knew)
Disappeared the moment you walked in
Now I'm recalibrating all my thoughts (all-my-thoughts)
As we begin this story once again
```

## Genre-Specific Applications

### Pop/Dance

- Use Line Plus Three consistently in chorus
- Create repetitive patterns that align with dance beats
- Emphasize with production elements (drums, synth stabs)

**Example:** “Dancing on my own” (on-my-own)

### R&B/Soul

- Use Line Plus for melismatic vocal opportunities
- Place on emotion-heavy words
- Leave space after Line Plus for vocal runs

**Example:** “I’m not the only one” (on-ly-one)

### Rock

- Use Line Plus with aggressive consonants for impact
- Create tension with instrumental emphasis on Line Plus
- Consider off-beat placement for edge

**Example:** “We will rock you” (rock-you)

### Folk/Acoustic

- Use subtler Line Plus implementation
- Focus on narrative-enhancing placements
- Incorporate naturalistic speech patterns

**Example:** “Blowin’ in the wind” (in-the-wind)

## Creation Process

### Step 1: Identify Target Words

Choose words with natural stress patterns that form your core message.

**Examples:**

- “memory” (mem-or-y)
- “beautiful” (beau-ti-ful)
- “suddenly” (sud-den-ly)

### Step 2: Build Backward

Construct lines that naturally lead to your Line Plus pattern.

**If your Line Plus is “memorize”:**

- “Everything about you I memorize”
- “These moments with you I memorize”
- “Your smile, your laugh, I memorize”

### Step 3: Create Parallel Structures

Develop multiple lines using the same rhythmic pattern.

**Pattern: “in my mind”**

- “Pictures playing in my mind”
- “Memories echoing in my mind”
- “Your voice lingering in my mind”

### Step 4: Test Singability

Ensure the Line Plus feels natural when sung, not forced.

**Test by:**

- Speaking the line with natural emphasis
- Singing the line with minimal melody
- Checking if Line Plus lands on strong beats

## Advanced Techniques

### Nested Line Plus

Combining multiple Line Plus patterns in a single line.

**Example:**
“Tell me now what happens in the dark” (Tell-me-now) + (in-the-dark)

### Evolving Line Plus

Slightly modifying the Line Plus pattern through different sections.

**Example:**

- Verse: “in the night”
- Chorus: “through the night”
- Bridge: “for the night”

### Contrasting Line Plus

Using opposite Line Plus patterns in verse vs. chorus.

**Example:**

- Verse: Line Plus Three (“in my head”)
- Chorus: Three Plus Line (“let me go”)

### Rhythmic Variation

Maintaining the same words but altering the rhythm.

**Example:**

- “I can’t help it” (normal pace)
- “I - can’t - help - it” (staccato emphasis)
