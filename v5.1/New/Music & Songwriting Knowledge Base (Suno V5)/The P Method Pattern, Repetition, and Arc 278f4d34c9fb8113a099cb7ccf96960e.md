# The P Method: Pattern, Repetition, and Arc

The P method is an approach to melody composition that utilizes three core elements of songwriting: Pattern, Repetition, and Arc. Developed to translate the intangible aspects of melody making into graspable parts, it offers a structured way to think about creating memorable songs and melodies. The creator believes that mastering melody writing involves learning how to tell a good song story using these three elements.

Here is a breakdown of each element:

1. **Pattern (P):** The P method posits that a song’s melody consists of a series of melody notes arranged in rhythmic patterns. Our brains are inherently wired to recognize and seek out patterns. When a recognizable rhythmic or melodic pattern is encountered, especially one that repeats, it becomes “hooky” and sticks in the listener’s mind. Learning about melodic patterns involves recognizing them, writing more memorable ones, and understanding how they relate to melody, rhythm, chords, and rhymes. The use of these patterns provides structure to a song and helps make different sections distinctive. A key pattern introduced within this framework is the “Line Plus Technique”. The Line Plus Technique, and its variations like Line Plus Three, Three Plus Line, Line Plus Two, and Two Plus Line, is a system of melodic pattern writing that makes songs hookier and grabs the listener’s attention. It involves understanding melody phrases by breaking them down into smaller parts containing fluid lines and rhythmic patterns. These patterns should ideally be consistent within sections like verses or choruses to create a memorable rhythmic hook, ensuring that the beats and syllables fall naturally within the rhythm without being forced.
2. **Repetition (R):** Following the establishment of patterns, strategic repetition is deemed crucial for making them memorable. Repetition is the art of repeating melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic patterns in a way that engages the listener and leaves a lasting impression. A successful song utilizes repeated patterns for this purpose. This element involves learning to create symmetry between melody, chords, and rhythm, as well as composing variant repeating patterns of these elements. While repetition is key, balancing it with variation is important to avoid monotony. Within this element, recognizing “hotspots” is also discussed. Hotspots are naturally occurring parts of a melodic line that draw the listener in. These are specific places in a melody that grab attention, such as the end of a phrase, rhyme points, high notes, and the first and last lines of sections, particularly choruses which often contain the song title.
3. **Arc (A):** The final element, Arc, refers to the rise and fall of the melodic story. It represents the musical and emotional journey a song takes the listener on from beginning to end. The belief is that successful song melodies tell stories not just in conjunction with lyrics, but separately through emotion and sound. Learning about arc involves arranging repeated patterns into a memorable song arc, building an emotional story across the song, and recognizing the role of each song section within this larger narrative. Just as listeners are riveted by a well-told story, the goal is for them to be hooked by well-written melodies that have a compelling arc. This involves contrasting song sections melodically and dynamically to create an engaging emotional ride.

The P method is recommended to be learned in the specific order of Pattern, then Repetition, and finally Arc. This is because each part builds upon the other, much like a beautiful melody itself. Understanding patterns provides the foundational building blocks, repetition teaches how to make those patterns memorable and engaging, and the arc provides the overarching structure and emotional journey that organizes these repeated patterns into a complete song.

In essence, the P method provides a structured approach to melody writing, emphasizing the deliberate use of recognizable patterns, strategic repetition, and a compelling emotional/musical journey to create melodies that are both hooky and memorable. It moves beyond simply describing a theme to crafting a musical journey that resonates deeply with the listener, a crucial aspect for capturing attention and creating a lasting impression.
